# Project Types
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] includes several project types for languages such as [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../vs140/includes/csprcs_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] also lets you create your own project types.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Project Type Essentials](../vs140/Project-Type-Essentials.md)  
 Presents the important information that you must have to start working with project types.  
  
 [Creating Project Types](../vs140/Creating-Project-Types.md)  
 Discusses the design of project types.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Adding a Command to the Solution Explorer Toolbar (C#)](../vs140/Adding-a-Command-to-the-Solution-Explorer-Toolbar.md)  
 Details the steps that you must follow to add a button to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] **Solution Explorer** toolbar.  
  
 [How to: Add Web Services to Project Systems](../Topic/Adding%20Web%20Services%20to%20Project%20Systems.md)  
 Shows how to integrate Web services into your VSPackage project system.  
  
 [How to: Rename Project Hierarchy Nodes (C++)](../Topic/Renaming%20Project%20Hierarchy%20Nodes%20\(C++\).md)  
 Shows how to rename a project folder hierarchy node.  
  
 [Adding Project and Project Item Templates](../vs140/Adding-Project-and-Project-Item-Templates.md)  
 Discusses how you can add templates to your project types so that users can create new projects and project items according to a pattern.  
  
 [Opening and Saving Project Items](../vs140/Opening-and-Saving-Project-Items.md)  
 Provides information about how to manage the items your project type supports.  
  
 [Managing Configuration Options](../vs140/Managing-Configuration-Options.md)  
 Discusses how your project types can support configuration options like Debug and Release that control how projects are built, debugged, and so forth.  
  
 [Supporting Source Control](../Topic/Supporting%20Source%20Control.md)  
 Provides information about how to add support for source-control systems to your project types.  
  
 [Nesting Projects](../vs140/Nesting-Projects.md)  
 Explains how your project types can support *nesting*, so that projects can be grouped together in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 [Upgrading Projects](../vs140/Upgrading-Projects.md)  
 Describes how your project type can participate in the Upgrade Wizard to upgrade project files from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
 [Project Types Architecture](../vs140/Project-Types-Architecture.md)  
 Provides detailed technical information about project types.

 [Project Subtypes](../Topic/Project%20Subtypes.md)  
 Provides links to project subtype topics. Project subtypes enable extension of most kinds of project types, including your own.  
  
 [Projects (Visual Studio SDK)](../vs140/Projects.md)  
 Describes how to extend the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project system.
