# _setmaxstdio
Sets a maximum for the number of simultaneously open files at the `stdio` level.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int _setmaxstdio(  
   int newmax   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `newmax`  
 New maximum for the number of simultaneously open files at the `stdio` level.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns `newmax` if successful; â€“1 otherwise.  
  
 If `newmax` is less than `_IOB_ENTRIES` or greater then the maximum number of handles available in the operating system, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../vs140/Parameter-Validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns -1 and sets `errno` to `EINVAL`.  
  
 For information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../vs140/errno--_doserrno--_sys_errlist--and-_sys_nerr.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_setmaxstdio` function changes the maximum value for the number of files that might be simultaneously open at the `stdio` level.  
  
 C run-time I/O now supports many more open files on Win32 platforms than in previous versions. Up to 2,048 files can be open simultaneously at the [lowio level](../vs140/Low-Level-I-O.md) (that is, opened and accessed by means of the `_open`, `_read`, `_write`, and so forth family of I/O functions). Up to 512 files can be open simultaneously at the [stdio level](../vs140/Stream-I-O.md) (that is, opened and accessed by means of the `fopen`, `fgetc`, `fputc`, and so forth family of functions). The limit of 512 open files at the `stdio` level can be increased to a maximum of 2,048 by means of the `_setmaxstdio` function.  
  
 Because `stdio`-level functions, such as `fopen`, are built on top of the `lowio` functions, the maximum of 2,048 is a hard upper limit for the number of simultaneously open files accessed through the C run-time library.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This upper limit might be beyond what is supported by a particular Win32 platform and configuration.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`_setmaxstdio`|<stdio.h>|  
  
 For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../vs140/Compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Example  
 See [_getmaxstdio](../vs140/_getmaxstdio.md) for an example of using `_setmaxstdio`.  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](assetId:///15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
