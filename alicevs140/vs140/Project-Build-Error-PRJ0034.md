# Project Build Error PRJ0034
The 'Additional Dependencies' property for the project-level custom build step contained 'macro' which evaluates out to 'macro_expansion'.  
  
 A custom build step on a project contained an error in its additional dependency probably due to a macro evaluation problem. This error could also mean that the path is badly formed, containing characters or combinations of characters that are illegal in a file path.  
  
 To resolve this error, fix the macro or fix the path specification. The evaluated path is an absolute path from the project directory.
