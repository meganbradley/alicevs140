|Title|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[operator new (CRT)](../vs140/operator-new--CRT-.md)|Allocates a block of memory from the heap.|  
|[operator new (<new\>)](../vs140/operator-new---new--.md)|The function that's called by a new-expression to allocate storage for individual objects.|  
|[new Operator](../vs140/new-Operator--C---.md)|Allocates memory for an object or array of objects from the free store and returns a suitably typed, nonzero pointer to the object.|  
|[new (new slot in vtable)](../vs140/new--new-slot-in-vtable----C---Component-Extensions-.md)|In a C++/CLI project, indicates that a virtual member gets a new slot in the vtable. In other words, the function does not override a base class method.|  
|[ref new, gcnew](../vs140/ref-new--gcnew---C---Component-Extensions-.md)|In a [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../vs140/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)] (`ref new`) or C++/CLI (`gcnew`) project, this compound keyword creates a reference-counted object.|
