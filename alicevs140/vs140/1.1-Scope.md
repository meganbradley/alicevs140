# 1.1 Scope
This specification covers only user-directed parallelization, wherein the user explicitly specifies the actions to be taken by the compiler and run-time system in order to execute the program in parallel. OpenMP C and C++ implementations are not required to check for dependencies, conflicts, deadlocks, race conditions, or other problems that result in incorrect program execution. The user is responsible for ensuring that the application using the OpenMP C and C++ API constructs executes correctly. Compiler-generated automatic parallelization and directives to the compiler to assist such parallelization are not covered in this document.
