# Adding Project and Project Item Templates
When you create your own project types, you must provide support for adding new projects and project items by using the standard [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) dialog boxes. The following topics discuss different techniques for adding projects and project items.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Project Context](../vs140/Project-Context.md)  
 Explains that the project provides most of the context information for what transpires in the environment.  
  
 [Project Priority](../Topic/Project%20Priority.md)  
 Explains that a project item is usually a member of one project to help avoid ambiguity about which project is used to open the item.  
  
 [Miscellaneous Files Project](../vs140/Miscellaneous-Files-Project.md)  
 Provides information about the two types of editors that can be used to open files in a project and the role the project plays in determining which editor to use when a project item is opened.  
  
 [Registering Project and Item Templates](../vs140/Registering-Project-and-Item-Templates.md)  
 Explains what occurs when a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project is created.  
  
 [Adding Items to the Add New Item Dialog Boxes](../Topic/Adding%20Items%20to%20the%20Add%20New%20Item%20Dialog%20Boxes.md)  
 Explains the process for adding items to the **Add New Item** dialog box.  
  
 [Adding Directories to the New Project Dialog Box](../vs140/Adding-Directories-to-the-New-Project-Dialog-Box.md)  
 Provides an example of registering a new directory that contains custom templates made available by a VSPackage.  
  
 [Adding Directories to the Add New Item Dialog Box](../vs140/Adding-Directories-to-the-Add-New-Item-Dialog-Box.md)  
 Provides an example of registering a new set of directories for the **Add New Item** dialog box.  
  
 [IDE-Defined Commands for Extending Project Systems](../Topic/IDE-Defined%20Commands%20for%20Extending%20Project%20Systems.md)  
 Lists different types of command items used for extending project systems.  
  
 [CATIDs for Objects Ordinarily Used to Extend Projects](../vs140/CATIDs-for-Objects-That-Are-Typically-Used-to-Extend-Projects.md)  
 Lists CATIDs for objects that are used to extend [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../vs140/includes/vcprvc_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../vs140/includes/csprcs_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project systems.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [How to: Open Project-Specific Editors](../vs140/How-to--Open-Project-Specific-Editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for opening an item intrinsically bound to a specific editor for a project.  
  
 [How to: Open Standard Editors](../vs140/How-to--Open-Standard-Editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for opening a standard editor.  
  
 [Project Subtypes](../Topic/Project%20Subtypes.md)  
 Provides links to project subtype conceptual topics. Project subtypes extend existing [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../vs140/includes/csprcs_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] projects.  
  
 [Project Types](../vs140/Project-Types.md)  
 Provides links to additional topics that offer information about how to design new project types.
