# CWnd::ShowWindow
Sets the visibility state of the window.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL ShowWindow(  
   int nCmdShow   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nCmdShow`  
 Specifies how the `CWnd` is to be shown. It must be one of the following values:  
  
-   **SW_HIDE** Hides this window and passes activation to another window.  
  
-   **SW_MINIMIZE** Minimizes the window and activates the top-level window in the system's list.  
  
-   **SW_RESTORE** Activates and displays the window. If the window is minimized or maximized, Windows restores it to its original size and position.  
  
-   **SW_SHOW** Activates the window and displays it in its current size and position.  
  
-   **SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED** Activates the window and displays it as a maximized window.  
  
-   **SW_SHOWMINIMIZED** Activates the window and displays it as an icon.  
  
-   **SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE** Displays the window as an icon. The window that is currently active remains active.  
  
-   **SW_SHOWNA** Displays the window in its current state. The window that is currently active remains active.  
  
-   **SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE** Displays the window in its most recent size and position. The window that is currently active remains active.  
  
-   **SW_SHOWNORMAL** Activates and displays the window. If the window is minimized or maximized, Windows restores it to its original size and position.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if the window was previously visible; 0 if the `CWnd` was previously hidden.  
  
## Remarks  
 `ShowWindow` must be called only once per application for the main window with [CWinApp::m_nCmdShow](../vs140/CWinApp--m_nCmdShow.md). Subsequent calls to `ShowWindow` must use one of the values listed above instead of the one specified by `CWinApp::m_nCmdShow`.  
  
## Example  
 See the example for [CWnd::CalcWindowRect](../vs140/CWnd--CalcWindowRect.md).
