# General Language Changes (C++-CLI)
A number of CLR language features changed from Managed Extensions for C++ to [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_long](../vs140/includes/cpp_current_long_md.md)].  
  
 The changes described in this section are a sort of language miscellany. It includes a change in the handling of string literals, a change in the overload resolution between an ellipsis and the `Param` attribute, the change of `typeof` to `typeid`, a change in the calling of constructor initializer lists, and the introduction of a new cast notation, that of `safe_cast`.  
  
 [String Literal](../vs140/String-Literal.md)  
 Discusses how the handling of string literals has changed.  
  
 [Param Array and Ellipsis](../vs140/Param-Array-and-Ellipsis.md)  
 Discusses how `ParamArray` is now given precedence over the ellipsis (`â€¦`) for resolving function calls with varying numbers of arguments.  
  
 [Typeof Goes to T::typeid](../vs140/typeof-Goes-to-T--typeid.md)  
 Discusses how the `typeof` operator has been supplanted by `typeid`.  
  
 [Initializer Lists](../vs140/Initializer-Lists.md)  
 Discusses changes in the calling order of initializer lists.  
  
 [Cast Notation and Introduction of safe_cast<>](../vs140/Cast-Notation-and-Introduction-of-safe_cast--.md)  
 Discusses changes to cast notation and in particular the introduction of `safe_cast`.
