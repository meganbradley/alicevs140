# Using CDateTimeCtrl
The date and time picker control ([CDateTimeCtrl](../vs140/CDateTimeCtrl-Class.md)) implements an intuitive and recognizable method of entering or selecting a specific date. The main interface of the control is similar in functionality to a combo box. However, if the user expands the control, a month calendar control appears (by default), allowing the user to specify a particular date. When a date is chosen, the month calendar control automatically disappears.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use both the **CDateTimePicker** and `CMonthCalCtrl` classes in your project, you must include AFXDTCTL.H, usually in your project's STDAFX.H file.
