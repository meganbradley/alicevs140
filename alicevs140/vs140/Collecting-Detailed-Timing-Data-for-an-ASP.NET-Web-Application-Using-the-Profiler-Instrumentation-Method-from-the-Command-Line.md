# Collecting Detailed Timing Data for an ASP.NET Web Application Using the Profiler Instrumentation Method from the Command Line
This section describes the procedures and options for collecting detailed performance data for an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../vs140/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Web application by using the **VSPerfCmd** command line tool and the instrumentation method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **VSPerfCmd** tool provides you with complete access to Profiling Tools functionality, including pausing and resuming profiling, and collecting additional data from processor and Windows performance counters. You can also use the  **VSPerfASPNETCmd** command-line tool when you do not need this functionality. In comparison to the [VSPerfCmd](../vs140/VSPerfCmd.md) command-line tool, no environment variables have to be set, and rebooting the computer is not required. For more information, see [Rapid Web Site Profiling with VSPerfASPNETCmd](../vs140/Rapid-Web-Site-Profiling-with-VSPerfASPNETCmd.md).
