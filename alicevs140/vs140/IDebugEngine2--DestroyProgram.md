# IDebugEngine2::DestroyProgram
Informs a debug engine (DE) that the program specified has been atypically terminated and that the DE should clean up all references to the program and send a program destroy event.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT DestroyProgram(   
   IDebugProgram2* pProgram  
);  
```  
  
```cpp#  
int DestroyProgram(   
   IDebugProgram2 pProgram  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pProgram`  
 [in] An [IDebugProgram2](../vs140/IDebugProgram2.md) object that represents the program that has been atypically terminated.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.  
  
## Remarks  
 After this method is called, the DE subsequently sends an [IDebugProgramDestroyEvent2](../vs140/IDebugProgramDestroyEvent2.md) event back to the session debug manager (SDM).  
  
 This method is not implemented (returns `E_NOTIMPL`) if the DE runs in the same process as the program being debugged. This method is implemented only if the DE runs in the same process as the SDM.
