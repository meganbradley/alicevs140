# concurrent_vector::at Method
Provides access to the element at the given index in the concurrent vector. This method is concurrency-safe for read operations, and also while growing the vector, as long as you have ensured that the value `_Index` is less than the size of the concurrent vector.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
reference at(  
   size_type _Index  
);  
  
const_reference at(  
   size_type _Index  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Index`  
 The index of the element to be retrieved.  
  
## Return Value  
 A reference to the item at the given index.  
  
## Remarks  
 The version of the function `at` that returns a non-`const` reference cannot be used to concurrently write to the element from different threads. A different synchronization object should be used to synchronize concurrent read and write operations to the same data element.  
  
 The method throws `out_of_range` if `_Index` is greater than or equal to the size of the concurrent vector, and `range_error` if the index is for a broken portion of the vector. For details on how a vector can become broken, see [Parallel Containers and Objects](../vs140/Parallel-Containers-and-Objects.md).
