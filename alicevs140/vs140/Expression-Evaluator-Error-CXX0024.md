# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0024
operation needs l-value  
  
 An expression that does not evaluate to an l-value was specified for an operation that requires an l-value.  
  
 An l-value (so called because it appears on the left side of an assignment statement) is an expression that refers to a memory location.  
  
 For example, `buffer[count]` is a valid l-value because it points to a specific memory location. The logical comparison `zed != 0` is not a valid l-value because it evaluates to TRUE or FALSE, not to a memory address.  
  
 This error is identical to CAN0024.
