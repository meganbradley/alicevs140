# Collecting Application Statistics for Services by Using the Profiler Sampling Method
This section describes the procedures and options for collecting performance statistics for Windows services using the sampling method from the command line.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Profiling Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../vs140/Performance-Tools-on-Windows-8-and-Windows-Server-2012-applications.md).
