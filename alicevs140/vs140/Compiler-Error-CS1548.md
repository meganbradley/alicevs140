# Compiler Error CS1548
Cryptographic failure while signing assembly 'assembly' â€” 'reason'  
  
 CS1548 occurs when assembly signing fails. This is usually due to an invalid key file name, an invalid key file path, or a corrupt key file.  
  
 To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys. To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information. The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed.  
  
 For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly (Visual Studio)](assetId:///f468a7d3-234c-4353-924d-8e0ae5896564), [/keyfile (Specify Strong Name Key File) (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-keyfile%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md) and [/delaysign (Delay Sign the Assembly) (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-delaysign%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).  
  
 When creating an assembly, the C# compiler calls into a utility called al.exe. If there is a failure in the assembly creation, the reason for the failure is reported by al.exe. See [Al.exe Tool Errors and Warnings](assetId:///7f125d49-0a03-47a6-9ba9-d61a679a7d4b) and search that topic for the text reported by the compiler in 'reason'.
