# Customizing Performance Tools Report Views
This section covers how to customize reports that are generated with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools.  
  
## Common Tasks  
  
|Task|Related Content|  
|----------|---------------------|  
|**Add, remove, and sort by columns in a report view:** You can specify the columns that you want to display in table-based views, and you can specify the order in which the columns appear. You can also sort the rows of the report table by the column values.|-   [How to: Customize Performance Report View Columns](../vs140/How-to--Customize-Report-View-Columns.md)|  
|**Eliminate small functions from the report:** You can eliminate functions that are smaller than a specified threshold from reports.|-   [How to: Configure Noise Reduction in Performance Reports](../vs140/How-to--Configure-Noise-Reduction-in-Report-Views.md)|  
|**Filter the date in a report view**: You can limit the data that appear in a report to a time segment of the profiling run. You can specify a time segment in the timeline graph of the Summary View, or you can specify the time segment in a query that you define in the report view filter. You can also filter the reports to show only functions that are defined in your code files.|-   [Filtering Performance Reports](../vs140/Filtering-Report-Views.md)<br />-   [How to: Filter Profiling Reports from the Summary Timeline](../vs140/How-to--Filter-Report-Views-from-the-Summary-Timeline.md)<br />-   [How to: Filter Reports to View Just My Code](../vs140/How-to--Filter-Profiling-Tools-Report-Views-to-Display-Just-My-Code.md)<br />-   [Profiler Report View Filter](../vs140/Performance-Report-View-Filter.md)|
