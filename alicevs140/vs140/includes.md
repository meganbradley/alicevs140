# includes
Tests whether one sorted range contains all the elements contained in a second sorted range, where the ordering or equivalence criterion between elements may be specified by a binary predicate.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2>  
   bool includes(  
      InputIterator1 _First1,   
      InputIterator1 _Last1,  
      InputIterator2 _First2,   
      InputIterator2 _Last1  
   );  
template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class BinaryPredicate>  
   bool includes(  
      InputIterator1 _First1,   
      InputIterator1 _Last1,  
      InputIterator2 _First2,   
      InputIterator2 _Last1,  
      BinaryPredicate _Comp  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_First1`  
 An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in the first of two sorted source ranges to be tested for whether all the elements of the second are contained in the first.  
  
 `_Last1`  
 An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in the first of two sorted source ranges to be tested for whether all the elements of the second are contained in the first.  
  
 `_First2`  
 An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in second of two consecutive sorted source ranges to be tested for whether all the elements of the second are contained in the first.  
  
 `_Last2`  
 An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in second of two consecutive sorted source ranges to be tested for whether all the elements of the second are contained in the first.  
  
 `_Comp`  
 User-defined predicate function object that defines sense in which one element is less than another. A binary predicate takes two arguments and returns **true** when satisfied and **false** when not satisfied.  
  
## Return Value  
 **true** if the first sorted range contains all the elements in the second sorted range; otherwise, **false**.  
  
## Remarks  
 Another way to think of this test is that it determined whether the second source range is a subset of the first source range.  
  
 The sorted source ranges referenced must be valid; all pointers must be dereferenceable and, within each sequence, the last position must be reachable from the first by incrementation.  
  
 The sorted source ranges must each be arranged as a precondition to the application of the algorithm includes in accordance with the same ordering as is to be used by the algorithm to sort the combined ranges.  
  
 The source ranges are not modified by the algorithm **merge**.  
  
 The value types of the input iterators need be less-than comparable to be ordered, so that, given two elements, it may be determined either that they are equivalent (in the sense that neither is less than the other) or that one is less than the other. This results in an ordering between the nonequivalent elements. More precisely, the algorithm tests whether all the elements in the first sorted range under a specified binary predicate have equivalent ordering to those in the second sorted range.  
  
 The complexity of the algorithm is linear with at most 2 \* ( (*_Last1 – _First1*) – (*_Last2 – _First2*) ) – 1 comparisons for nonempty source ranges.  
  
## Example  
  
```

// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <vector>  
#include <algorithm>  
#include <functional>      // For greater<int>( )  
#include <iostream>  
  
// Return whether modulus of elem1 is less than modulus of elem2  
bool mod_lesser (int elem1, int elem2 )  
{  
   if ( elem1 < 0 )   
      elem1 = - elem1;  
   if ( elem2 < 0 )   
      elem2 = - elem2;  
   return elem1 < elem2;  
}
