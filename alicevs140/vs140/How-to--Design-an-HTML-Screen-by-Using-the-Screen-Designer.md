# How to: Design an HTML Screen by Using the Screen Designer
By using the screen designer, you can modify the appearance of screens in an HTML client for a Visual Studio LightSwitch app. For example, you can use the designer to accomplish the following tasks.  
  
-   [Add a tab to a screen](../vs140/How-to--Design-an-HTML-Screen-by-Using-the-Screen-Designer.md#tab).  
  
-   [Add a group of information to a screen](#add2).  
  
-   [Modify the layout of a group](#modify).  
  
-   [Add a button](#add3).  
  
-   [Add an item](#add).  
  
-   [Remove an item](#remove).  
  
-   [Move an item](#move).  
  
-   [Change the display name of an item](#change).  
  
-   [Change the label position of an item](#change3).  
  
-   [Change the size of an item](#change4).  
  
-   [Show or hide an item](#specify).  
  
-   [Change the control type of an item](#change2).  
  
-   [Add a custom control to a screen](#custom).  
  
-   [Undo changes](#reverse).  
  
-   [Enable or disable paging](#paging).

-   In the **Screen Members List** of the **Screen Designer**, drag an item (for example, a field or a command) to the appropriate location in the **Screen Content Tree**.  
  
     As you drag the item, the pointer indicates whether you can move the item to a given location. If the pointer changes to a circle with a slash through it, you can’t drop the item in that location.  
  
     For information about how to add custom fields to a screen, see [How to: Add a Local Property to an HTML Screen](../vs140/How-to--Add-a-Local-Property-to-an-HTML-Screen.md).

2.  On the **Screen Designer** toolbar, choose the **Delete** button.  
  
##  <a name="move"></a> Move an Item  
  
-   In the **Screen Content Tree**, drag an item (for example, a field or a command) to the a different location.  
  
     For example, drag the `PostalCode` field so that it appears under the `Country` field, or drag the **Edit** button so that it appears over the **Delete** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  As you drag a field, the pointer indicates whether you can move the item to a given location. If the pointer changes to a circle with a slash through it, you cannot move the item to that location.

2.  In the **Properties** window, in the text box under **Display Name**, enter a different name for the item.  
  
     If you change the display name of an item, you change only the name that appears in the screen. The `Name` property of the item stays the same.  
  
##  <a name="change3"></a> Change the Label Position of an Item  
  
1.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, choose the field.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, open the list under **Label Position**, and then choose the position that you want.  
  
     The following table describes each option.

    |--------------------|-----------------|  
    |**Left-aligned**|The label appears near the left side of the control.|  
    |**Right-aligned**|The label appears  near the right side of the control.|  
    |**Top**|The label appears above the control.|  
    |**Hidden**|No label appears for the control.|

##  <a name="change4"></a> Change the Size of an Item  
  
1.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, choose the item (for example, a field or a command).  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, under **Sizing**, choose a different size for the width and height of the control.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Some types of controls don’t support the height properties.  
  
     For information about each setting, see [Reference: Screen Designer Properties](../vs140/Reference--Screen-Designer-Properties.md).  
  
##  <a name="specify"></a> Show or Hide an Item  
  
1.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, choose the item (for example, a field or a command).  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, select or clear the check box for the **Is Visible** property.

1.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, open the list next to the item, and then choose the control type that you want.  
  
     Most control types are built in. You can also set the control type to a custom control that you create by using other tools. For more information, see [How to: Add a Custom Control to an HTML Screen](../vs140/How-to--Add-a-Custom-Control-to-an-HTML-Screen-for-a-LightSwitch-App.md).

2.  On the **Screen Designer** toolbar, open the **Add Layout Item** list, and then choose **Custom Control**.  
  
     For more information, see [How to: Add a Custom Control to an HTML Screen](../vs140/How-to--Add-a-Custom-Control-to-an-HTML-Screen-for-a-LightSwitch-App.md).  
  
##  <a name="reverse"></a> Undo Changes  
  
-   On the menu bar, choose **Edit**, **Undo**.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  If you accidentally undo an edit in the **Screen Designer**, on the menu bar, choose **Edit**, **Redo**.  
  
##  <a name="paging"></a> Enable or Disable Paging  
  
1.  In the **Screen Members List** of the **Screen Designer**, choose the parent node of a collection (for example, the `OrderCollection` heading).  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, clear the **Support paging** check box if you want to display all rows that a query returns, even if the collection of rows is large. Select the check box if you want to limit the number of records that appear, and then specify the number of items to display on each page.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Users can display each page of results by choosing a link in the screen.
