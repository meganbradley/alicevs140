# _CrtMemCheckpoint
Obtains the current state of the debug heap and stores in an application-supplied `_CrtMemState` structure (debug version only).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void _CrtMemCheckpoint(  
   _CrtMemState *state   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `state`  
 Pointer to `_CrtMemState` structure to fill with the memory checkpoint.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_CrtMemCheckpoint` function creates a snapshot of the current state of the debug heap at any given moment. This snapshot can be used by other heap state functions such as [_CrtMemDifference](../vs140/_CrtMemDifference.md) to help detect memory leaks and other problems. When [_DEBUG](../vs140/_DEBUG.md) is not defined, calls to `_CrtMemState` are removed during preprocessing.  
  
 The application must pass a pointer to a previously allocated instance of the `_CrtMemState` structure, defined in Crtdbg.h, in the `state` parameter. If `_CrtMemCheckpoint` encounters an error during the checkpoint creation, the function generates a `_CRT_WARN` debug report describing the problem.  
  
 For more information about heap state functions and the `_CrtMemState` structure, see [Heap State Reporting Functions](../vs140/CRT-Debug-Heap-Details.md#BKMK_Heap_State_Reporting_Functions). For more information about how memory blocks are allocated, initialized, and managed in the debug version of the base heap, see [CRT Debug Heap Details](../vs140/CRT-Debug-Heap-Details.md).  
  
 If `state` is `NULL`, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../vs140/Parameter-Validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, [errno, _doserrno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../vs140/errno--_doserrno--_sys_errlist--and-_sys_nerr.md) is set to `EINVAL` and the function returns.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`_CrtMemCheckpoint`|<crtdbg.h>, <errno.h>|  
  
 For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../vs140/Compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
 **Libraries:** Debug versions of the UCRT only.  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](assetId:///15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
