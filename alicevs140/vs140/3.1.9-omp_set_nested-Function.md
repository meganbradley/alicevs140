# 3.1.9 omp_set_nested Function
The **omp_set_nested** function enables or disables nested parallelism. The format is as follows:  
  
```  
#include <omp.h>  
void omp_set_nested(int nested);  
```  
  
 If *nested* evaluates to 0, nested parallelism is disabled, which is the default, and nested parallel regions are serialized and executed by the current thread. If *nested* evaluates to a nonzero value, nested parallelism is enabled, and parallel regions that are nested may deploy additional threads to form nested teams.  
  
 This function has the effects described above when called from a portion of the program where the **omp_in_parallel** function returns zero. If it is called from a portion of the program where the **omp_in_parallel** function returns a nonzero value, the behavior of this function is undefined.  
  
 This call has precedence over the **OMP_NESTED** environment variable.  
  
 When nested parallelism is enabled, the number of threads used to execute nested parallel regions is implementation-defined. As a result, OpenMP-compliant implementations are allowed to serialize nested parallel regions even when nested parallelism is enabled.
