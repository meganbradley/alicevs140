template<  
   typename  T  
   > class CAutoVectorPtr  
  
```

## Remarks  
 This class provides methods for creating and managing a smart pointer, which will help protect against memory leaks by automatically freeing resources when it falls out of scope. `CAutoVectorPtr` is similar to `CAutoPtr`, the only difference being that `CAutoVectorPtr` uses [vector new&#91;&#93;](../vs140/operator-new--new--.md) and [vector delete&#91;&#93;](../vs140/operator-delete--new--.md) to allocate and free memory instead of the C++                 **new** and **delete** operators. See [CAutoVectorPtrElementTraits](../vs140/CAutoVectorPtrElementTraits-Class.md) if collection classes of `CAutoVectorPtr` are required.  
  
 See [CAutoPtr](../vs140/CAutoPtr-Class.md) for an example of using a smart pointer class.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlbase.h  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__allocate"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::Allocate  
 Call this method to allocate the memory required by the array of objects pointed to by `CAutoVectorPtr`.  
  
```  
  
bool Allocate(  
      size_t  nElements  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nElements`  
 The number of elements in the array.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns true if the memory is successfully allocated, false on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 In debug builds, an assertion failure will occur if the [CAutoVectorPtr::m_p](../vs140/CAutoVectorPtr--m_p.md) member variable currently points to an existing value; that is, it is not equal to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__attach"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::Attach  
 Call this method to take ownership of an existing pointer.  
  
```  
  
void Attach(  
      T*  p  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `p`  
 The `CAutoVectorPtr` object will take ownership of this pointer.  
  
### Remarks  
 When a `CAutoVectorPtr` object takes ownership of a pointer, it will automatically delete the pointer and any allocated data when it goes out of scope. If [CAutoVectorPtr::Detach](../vs140/CAutoVectorPtr--Detach.md) is called, the programmer is again given responsibility for freeing any allocated resources.  
  
 In debug builds, an assertion failure will occur if the [CAutoVectorPtr::m_p](../vs140/CAutoVectorPtr--m_p.md) member variable currently points to an existing value; that is, it is not equal to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__cautovectorptr"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::CAutoVectorPtr  
 The constructor.  
  
```  
  
CAutoVectorPtr( ) throw( );Â   
   explicit CAutoVectorPtr(  
      T*  p  
   ) throw( );  
   CAutoVectorPtr(  
      CAutoVectorPtr< T >&  p  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `p`  
 An existing pointer.  
  
### Remarks  
 The `CAutoVectorPtr` object can be created using an existing pointer, in which case it transfers ownership of the pointer.  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr___dtorcautovectorptr"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::~CAutoVectorPtr  
 The destructor.  
  
```  
  
~CAutoVectorPtr( ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Frees any allocated resources. Calls [CAutoVectorPtr::Free](../vs140/CAutoVectorPtr--Free.md).  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__detach"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::Detach  
 Call this method to release ownership of a pointer.  
  
```  
  
T* Detach( ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns a copy of the pointer.  
  
### Remarks  
 Releases ownership of a pointer, sets the [CAutoVectorPtr::m_p](../vs140/CAutoVectorPtr--m_p.md) member variable to NULL, and returns a copy of the pointer. After calling **Detach**, it is up to the programmer to free any allocated resources over which the `CAutoVectorPtr` object may have previously assumed responsibility.  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__free"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::Free  
 Call this method to delete an object pointed to by a `CAutoVectorPtr`.  
  
```  
  
void Free( ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The object pointed to by the `CAutoVectorPtr` is freed, and the [CAutoVectorPtr::m_p](../vs140/CAutoVectorPtr--m_p.md) member variable is set to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__m_p"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::m_p  
 The pointer data member variable.  
  
```  
  
T* m_p;  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 This member variable holds the pointer information.  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__operator__eq"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::operator =  
 The assignment operator.  
  
```  
  
CAutoVectorPtr< T >& operator =(  
      CAutoVectorPtr< T >&  p  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `p`  
 A pointer.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns a reference to a **CAutoVectorPtr< T >**.  
  
### Remarks  
 The assignment operator detaches the `CAutoVectorPtr` object from any current pointer and attaches the new pointer, `p`, in its place.  
  
##  <a name="cautovectorptr__operator_t__star"></a>  CAutoVectorPtr::operator T *  
 The cast operator.  
  
```  
  
operator T*( ) const throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Returns a pointer to the object data type defined in the class template.
