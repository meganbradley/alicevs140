# vector::difference_type
A type that provides the difference between two iterators that refer to elements within the same vector.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef typename Allocator::difference_type difference_type;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 A `difference_type` can also be described as the number of elements between two pointers, because a pointer to an element contains its address.  
  
 An [iterator](../vs140/vector--iterator.md) is more commonly used to access a vector element.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// vector_diff_type.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <iostream>  
#include <vector>  
#include <algorithm>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
  
   vector <int> c1;  
   vector <int>::iterator c1_Iter, c2_Iter;  
  
   c1.push_back( 30 );  
   c1.push_back( 20 );  
   c1.push_back( 30 );  
   c1.push_back( 10 );  
   c1.push_back( 30 );  
   c1.push_back( 20 );  
  
   c1_Iter = c1.begin( );  
   c2_Iter = c1.end( );  
  
   vector <int>::difference_type   df_typ1, df_typ2, df_typ3;  
  
   df_typ1 = count( c1_Iter, c2_Iter, 10 );  
   df_typ2 = count( c1_Iter, c2_Iter, 20 );  
   df_typ3 = count( c1_Iter, c2_Iter, 30 );  
   cout << "The number '10' is in c1 collection " << df_typ1 << " times.\n";  
   cout << "The number '20' is in c1 collection " << df_typ2 << " times.\n";  
   cout << "The number '30' is in c1 collection " << df_typ3 << " times.\n";  
}  
```  
  
 **The number '10' is in c1 collection 1 times.**  
**The number '20' is in c1 collection 2 times.**  
**The number '30' is in c1 collection 3 times.**   
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <vector\>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
