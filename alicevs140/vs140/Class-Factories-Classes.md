# Class Factories Classes
The following classes implement or support a class factory:  
  
-   [CComClassFactory](../vs140/CComClassFactory-Class.md) Provides a default class factory for object creation.  
  
-   [CComClassFactory2](../vs140/CComClassFactory2-Class.md) Controls object creation through a license.  
  
-   [CComClassFactoryAutoThread](../vs140/CComClassFactoryAutoThread-Class.md) Allows objects to be created in multiple thread-pooled apartments.  
  
-   [CComClassFactorySingleton](../vs140/CComClassFactorySingleton-Class.md) Creates a single object.  
  
-   [CComCoClass](../vs140/CComCoClass-Class.md) Defines the class factory for the object.
