# timer Class
A             `timer` messaging block is a single-target             `source_block` capable of sending a message to its target after a specified time period has elapsed or at specific intervals.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<  
   class             _Type  
>  
class timer : public Concurrency::details::_Timer, public source_block<single_link_registry<ITarget<            _Type>>>;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Type`  
 The payload type of the output messages of this block.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[timer::timer Constructor](#timer__timer_constructor)|Overloaded. Constructs a                                         `timer` messaging block that will fire a given message after a specified interval.|  
|[timer::~timer Destructor](#timer___dtortimer_destructor)|Destroys a                                         `timer` messaging block.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[timer::pause Method](#timer__pause_method)|Stops the                                         `timer` messaging block. If it is a repeating                                         `timer` messaging block, it can be restarted with a subsequent                                         `start()` call. For non-repeating timers, this has the same effect as a                                         `stop` call.|  
|[timer::start Method](#timer__start_method)|Starts the                                         `timer` messaging block. The specified number of milliseconds after this is called, the specified value will be propagated downstream as a                                         `message`.|  
|[timer::stop Method](#timer__stop_method)|Stops the                                         `timer` messaging block.|  
  
### Protected Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[timer::accept_message Method](#timer__accept_message_method)|Accepts a message that was offered by this                                         `timer` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.|

 `timer`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="timer__accept_message_method"></a>  timer::accept_message Method  
 Accepts a message that was offered by this                 `timer` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * accept_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the offered                                 `message` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the                         `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
##  <a name="timer__consume_message_method"></a>  timer::consume_message Method  
 Consumes a message previously offered by the                 `timer` and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * consume_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the                                 `message` object being consumed.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the                         `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 Similar to                         `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to                         `reserve`.  
  
##  <a name="timer__link_target_notification_method"></a>  timer::link_target_notification Method  
 A callback that notifies that a new target has been linked to this                 `timer` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void link_target_notification(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the newly linked target.  
  
##  <a name="timer__pause_method"></a>  timer::pause Method  
 Stops the                 `timer` messaging block. If it is a repeating                 `timer` messaging block, it can be restarted with a subsequent                 `start()` call. For non-repeating timers, this has the same effect as a                 `stop` call.  
  
```  
void pause();  
```  
  
##  <a name="timer__propagate_to_any_targets_method"></a>  timer::propagate_to_any_targets Method  
 Tries to offer the message produced by the                 `timer` block to all of the linked targets.  
  
```  
virtual void propagate_to_any_targets(  
   _Inout_opt_ message<_Type> *  
);  
```  
  
##  <a name="timer__release_message_method"></a>  timer::release_message Method  
 Releases a previous message reservation.  
  
```  
virtual void release_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the                                 `message` object being released.  
  
##  <a name="timer__reserve_message_method"></a>  timer::reserve_message Method  
 Reserves a message previously offered by this                 `timer` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual bool reserve_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the                                 `message` object being reserved.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved,                         `false` otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 After                         `reserve` is called, if it returns                         `true`, either                         `consume` or                         `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  
  
##  <a name="timer__resume_propagation_method"></a>  timer::resume_propagation Method  
 Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  
  
```  
virtual void resume_propagation();  
```  
  
##  <a name="timer__start_method"></a>  timer::start Method  
 Starts the                 `timer` messaging block. The specified number of milliseconds after this is called, the specified value will be propagated downstream as a                 `message`.  
  
```  
void start();  
```  
  
##  <a name="timer__stop_method"></a>  timer::stop Method  
 Stops the                 `timer` messaging block.  
  
```  
void stop();  
```  
  
##  <a name="timer__timer_constructor"></a>  timer::timer Constructor  
 Constructs a                 `timer` messaging block that will fire a given message after a specified interval.  
  
```  
timer(  
   unsigned int                 _Ms,  
   _Type const&                 _Value,  
   ITarget<_Type> *                _PTarget = NULL,  
   bool                 _Repeating = false  
);  
  
timer(  
   Scheduler&                 _Scheduler,  
   unsigned int                 _Ms,  
   _Type const&                 _Value,  
   _Inout_opt_ ITarget<_Type> *                _PTarget = NULL,  
   bool                 _Repeating = false  
);  
  
timer(  
   ScheduleGroup&                 _ScheduleGroup,  
   unsigned int                 _Ms,  
   _Type const&                 _Value,  
   _Inout_opt_ ITarget<_Type> *                _PTarget = NULL,  
   bool                 _Repeating = false  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Ms`  
 The number of milliseconds that must elapse after the call to start for the specified message to be propagated downstream.  
  
 `_Value`  
 The value which will be propagated downstream when the timer elapses.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 The target to which the timer will propagate its message.  
  
 `_Repeating`  
 If true, indicates that the timer will fire periodically every                                 `_Ms` milliseconds.  
  
 `_Scheduler`  
 The                                 `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the                                 `timer` messaging block is scheduled is scheduled.  
  
 `_ScheduleGroup`  
 The                                 `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the                                 `timer` messaging block is scheduled. The                                 `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the                         `_Scheduler` or                         `_ScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
##  <a name="timer___dtortimer_destructor"></a>  timer::~timer Destructor  
 Destroys a                 `timer` messaging block.  
  
```  
~timer();  
```
