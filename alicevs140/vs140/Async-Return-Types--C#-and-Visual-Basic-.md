# Async Return Types (C# and Visual Basic)
Visual Basic and C# share many common concepts, but with often subtle differences. Where previous versions of the documentation presented shared concepts in topics that covered both languages, the current documentation presents each language in it's own topic.  
  
-   [Async Return Types (Visual Basic)](../Topic/Async%20Return%20Types%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md)  
  
-   [Async Return Types (C#)](../Topic/Async%20Return%20Types%20\(C%23\).md)
