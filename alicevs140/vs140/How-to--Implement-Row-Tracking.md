# How to: Implement Row Tracking
If you implement row tracking in your LightSwitch database, you can track who added or modified row-level data and when. If the **Enable Created/Modified properties** check box is selected, **Created**, **CreatedBy**, **Modified**, and **ModifiedBy** fields are automatically added to a table when a user changes data.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This property is available for tables in the intrinsic database only. For attached data sources, you must implement row tracking in the data source.  
  
 The **Created** and **Modified** fields use the **DateTimeOffset** custom data type, which stores the date and time relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The **CreatedBy** and **ModifiedBy** fields use the **Person** custom data type. These four fields are hidden in the Data Designer, but they appear in the Screen Designer so that you can display them on a screen if you want.  
  
 If you implement row tracking, you can filter data based on a specific user by using the **Current User** global value. For example, you can allow users to display only those records that they created.  
  
### To implement row tracking  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for an entity or table, and then choose **Open**.  
  
2.  In the Data Designer, on the **Perspective** bar, choose the **Server** tab.  
  
3.  In the Properties window, select the **Enable Created/Modified properties** check box.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For new tables, that check box is selected by default.  
  
### To filter rows based on the current user  
  
1.  In the Data Designer, on the **Perspective** bar, choose the **Server** tab.  
  
2.  On the toolbar, choose the **Query** button.  
  
3.  In the Query Designer, choose the **Add Filter** link.  
  
4.  In the second list, choose **CreatedBy**.  
  
5.  In the fourth list, choose **Global**.  
  
6.  In the fifth list, choose **Current User**.
