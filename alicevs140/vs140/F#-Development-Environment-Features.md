# F# Development Environment Features
This topic includes information about which features of [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../vs140/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] are supported in F#.  
  
## Project Features  
 The following table summarizes the templates that are available for use in F# projects. For information about project and item templates, see [NIB Creating Projects from Templates](assetId:///7c36d86a-6b79-4480-8228-0f925f1204b2).  
  
|Template type|Description|Supported templates|  
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|  
|Project templates|Types of projects available in the **New Project** dialog box.|-   F# Application<br />-   F# Library<br />-   F# Tutorial<br />-   F# Portable Library<br />-   F# Silverlight Library|  
|Item templates|File types available in the **Add New Item** dialog box.|-   F# source file (.fs)<br />-   F# script (.fsx)<br />-   F# signature file (.fsi)<br />-   Configuration file (.config)<br />-   SQL Database Connection (LINQ-to-SQL type provider)<br />-   SQL Database Connection (LINQ to Entities type provider)<br />-   OData Service Connection (LINQ type provider)<br />-   WSDL Service Connection (type provider)<br />-   XML file (.xml)<br />-   Text file|  
  
 To create an application that can run as a standalone executable, choose the F# Application project type. To create a library (that is, a managed assembly or .DLL file) for use on the Windows desktop platform, choose F# Library. To create a portable library that can be used on any supported platform, choose F# Portable Library. F# Portable Library projects reference a version of FSharp.Core.dll (2.3.5.0) that is appropriate to create an F# library that can be used with applications that run on the following platforms: [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps, the .NET Framework 4.5, and Silverlight 5. Older versions of Silverlight aren't supported.  
  
 For more information about the item templates for data access, see [Type Providers](../vs140/Type-Providers.md).  
  
 The following table summarizes project-properties features supported and not supported in F#. For more information, see [Configuring Projects in F#](../vs140/Configuring-Projects--F#-.md) and [Introduction to the Project Designer](assetId:///898dd854-c98d-430c-ba1b-a913ce3c73d7).
