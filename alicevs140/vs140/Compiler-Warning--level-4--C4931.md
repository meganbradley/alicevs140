# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4931
we are assuming the type library was built for number-bit pointers  
  
 Explicit information was not supplied with the **ptrsize** attribute of the [#import](../vs140/#import-Directive--C---.md) directive; the compiler concluded that pointer size of the type library is ***number***.  
  
 This warning is off by default. See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../vs140/Compiler-Warnings-That-Are-Off-by-Default.md) for more information.
