# How to: Change the Appearance of a DataRepeater Control (Visual Studio)
You can change the appearance of a <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater?qualifyHint=False> control at design time by setting properties or at run time by handling the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.DrawItem?qualifyHint=False> event.  
  
 Properties that you set at design time when the item template section of the control is selected will be repeated for each <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeaterItem?qualifyHint=False> at run time. Appearance-related properties of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater?qualifyHint=False> control itself will be visible at run time only if a part of the container is left uncovered (for example, if the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Padding?qualifyHint=False> property is set to a large value).  
  
 At run time, appearance-related properties can be set based on conditions. For example, in a scheduling application, you might change the background color of an item to warn users when an item is past due. In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.DrawItem?qualifyHint=False> event handler, if you set a property in a conditional statement such as `Ifâ€¦Then`, you must also use an `Else` clause to specify the appearance when the condition is not met.  
  
### To change the appearance at design time  
  
1.  In the Windows Forms Designer, select the item template (upper) region of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater?qualifyHint=False> control.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, select a property and change the value. Common properties that affect appearance include <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor?qualifyHint=False>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage?qualifyHint=False>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle?qualifyHint=False>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ForeColor?qualifyHint=False>.  
  
### To change the appearance at run time  
  
1.  In the Code Editor, in the Event drop-down list, click **DrawItem**.  
  
2.  In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.DrawItem?qualifyHint=False> event handler, add code to set the properties:  
  
     [!CODE [VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAppearance#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAppearance#1)]  
  
## Example  
 Some common customizations for the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater?qualifyHint=False> control include displaying the rows in alternating colors and changing the color of a field based on a condition. The following example shows how to perform these customizations. This example assumes that you have a <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater?qualifyHint=False> control that is bound to the Products table in the Northwind database.  
  
 [!CODE [VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAlternateBackColor#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAlternateBackColor#1)]  
  
 Note that for both of these customizations, you must provide code to set the properties for both sides of the condition. If you do not specify the `Else` condition, you will see unexpected results at run time.
