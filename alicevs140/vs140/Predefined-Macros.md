# Predefined Macros
The Visual C++ compiler predefines certain preprocessor macros, depending on the language (C or C++), the compilation target, and the chosen compiler options.  
  
 Visual C++ supports the required predefined preprocessor macros specified by the ANSI/ISO C99 standard and the ISO C++14 standard. The implementation also supports several more Microsoft-specific preprocessor macros. Some macros are defined only for specific build environments or compiler options. Unless noted, the macros are defined throughout a translation unit as if they were specified as **/D** compiler option arguments. When defined, the macros are expanded to the specified values by the preprocessor before compilation. The predefined macros take no arguments and cannot be redefined.  
  
## Standard predefined identifier  
 The compiler supports this predefined identifier specified by ISO C99 and ISO C++11.  
  
-   **__func\_\_** The unqualified and unadorned name of the enclosing function as a function-local `static``const` array of `char`.  
  
    ```cpp  
    void example(){  
        printf("%s\n", __func__);  
    } // prints "example"  
    ```  
  
## Standard predefined macros  
 The compiler supports these predefined macros specified by the ISO C99 and ISO C++14 standards.  
  
-   **__cplusplus** Defined as an integer literal value when the translation unit is compiled as C++. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **__DATE\_\_** The compilation date of the current source file. The date is a constant length string literal of the form *Mmm dd yyyy*. The month name *Mmm* is the same as the abbreviated month name in dates generated by the C Runtime Library [asctime](../vs140/asctime--_wasctime.md) function. The first character of date *dd* is a space if the value is less than 10. This macro is always defined.  
  
-   **__FILE\_\_** The name of the current source file. **__FILE\_\_** expands to a character string literal. To ensure that the full path to the file is displayed, use [/FC (Full Path of Source Code File in Diagnostics)](../Topic/-FC%20\(Full%20Path%20of%20Source%20Code%20File%20in%20Diagnostics\).md). This macro is always defined.  
  
-   **__LINE\_\_** Defined as the integer line number in the current source file. The value of the **__LINE\_\_** macro can be changed by using a `#line` directive. This macro is always defined.  
  
-   **__STDC\_\_** Defined as 1 only when compiled as C and if the [/Za](../Topic/-Za,%20-Ze%20\(Disable%20Language%20Extensions\).md) compiler option is specified. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **__STDC_HOSTED\_\_** Defined as 1 if the implementation is a *hosted implementation*, one that supports the entire required standard library. Otherwise, defined as 0.  
  
-   **__STDCPP_THREADS\_\_** Defined as 1 if and only if a program can have more than one thread of execution, and compiled as C++. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **__TIME\_\_** The time of translation of the preprocessed translation unit. The time is a character string literal of the form *hh:mm:ss*, the same as the time returned by the C Runtime Library [asctime](../vs140/asctime--_wasctime.md) function. This macro is always defined.  
  
## Microsoft-specific predefined macros  
 Microsoft Visual C++ supports these additional predefined macros.  
  
-   **__ATOM\_\_** Defined as 1 when the [/favor:ATOM](../Topic/-favor%20\(Optimize%20for%20Architecture%20Specifics\).md) compiler option is set and the compiler target is x86 or x64. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **__AVX\_\_** Defined as 1 when the [/arch:AVX](../vs140/-arch--x86-.md) or [/arch:AVX2](../vs140/-arch--x86-.md) compiler options are set and the compiler target is x86 or x64. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **__AVX2\_\_** Defined as 1 when the [/arch:AVX2](../vs140/-arch--x86-.md) compiler option is set and the compiler target is x86 or x64. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **_CHAR_UNSIGNED** Defined as 1 if the default `char` type is unsigned. This is set when the [/J (Default char Type Is unsigned)](../vs140/-J--Default-char-Type-Is-unsigned-.md) compiler option is set. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **__CLR_VER** Defined as an integer literal that represents the version of the common language runtime used when the application was compiled. The value is encoded in the form `Mmmbbbbb`, where `M` is the major version of the runtime, `mm` is the minor version of the runtime, and `bbbbb` is the build number. **__CLR_VER** is defined if the [/clr](../Topic/-clr%20\(Common%20Language%20Runtime%20Compilation\).md) compiler option is set. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
    ```cpp  
    // clr_ver.cpp  
    // compile with: /clr  
    using namespace System;  
    int main() {  
       Console::WriteLine(__CLR_VER);  
    }  
    ```  
  
-   **_CONTROL_FLOW_GUARD** Defined as 1 when the [/guard:cf (Enable Control Flow Guard)](../vs140/-guard--Enable-Control-Flow-Guard-.md) compiler option is set. Otherwise, undefined.  
  
-   **__COUNTER\_\_** Expands to an integer literal that starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 every time it is used in a source file or included headers of the source file. **__COUNTER\_\_** remembers its state when you use precompiled headers. This macro is always defined.  
  
     This example uses `__COUNTER__` to assign unique identifiers to three different objects of the same type. The `exampleClass` constructor takes an integer as a parameter. In `main`, the application declares three objects of type `exampleClass`, using `__COUNTER__` as the unique identifier parameter:  
  
    ```cpp  
    // macro__COUNTER__.cpp  
    // Demonstration of __COUNTER__, assigns unique identifiers to  
    // different objects of the same type.  
    // Compile by using: cl /EHsc /W4 macro__COUNTER__.cpp  
    #include <stdio.h>  
  
    class exampleClass {  
        int m_nID;  
    public:  
        // initialize object with a read-only unique ID  
        exampleClass(int nID) : m_nID(nID) {}  
        int GetID(void) { return m_nID; }  
    };  
  
    int main()  
    {  
        // __COUNTER__ is initially defined as 0  
        exampleClass e1(__COUNTER__);  
  
        // On the second reference, __COUNTER__ is now defined as 1  
        exampleClass e2(__COUNTER__);  
  
        // __COUNTER__ is now defined as 2  
        exampleClass e3(__COUNTER__);  
  
        printf("e1 ID: %i\n", e1.GetID());  
        printf("e2 ID: %i\n", e2.GetID());  
        printf("e3 ID: %i\n", e3.GetID());  
  
        // Output  
        // ------------------------------  
        // e1 ID: 0  
        // e2 ID: 1  
        // e3 ID: 2  
  
        return 0;  
    }  
    ```

Otherwise, undefined. When defined, **__cplusplus_cli** is in effect throughout the translation unit.  
  
    ```cpp  
    // cplusplus_cli.cpp  
    // compile by using /clr  
    #include "stdio.h"  
    int main() {  
       #ifdef __cplusplus_cli  
          printf("%d\n", __cplusplus_cli);

    }  
    ```  
  
-   **__INTELLISENSE\_\_** Defined as 1 during an IntelliSense compiler pass in the Visual Studio IDE. Otherwise, undefined. You can use this macro to guard code the IntelliSense compiler does not understand, or use it to toggle between the build and IntelliSense compiler. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Tips for IntelliSense Slowness](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2011/03/29/troubleshooting-tips-for-intellisense-slowness/).

 Preprocessor macros used to determine the ATL or MFC library version are not predefined by the compiler. These macros are defined in the headers for the library, so they are undefined in preprocessor directives before the required header is included.  
  
-   **_ATL_VER** Defined in <atldef.h> as an integer literal that encodes the ATL version number.  
  
-   **_MFC_VER** Defined in <afxver_.h> as an integer literal that encodes the MFC version number.
