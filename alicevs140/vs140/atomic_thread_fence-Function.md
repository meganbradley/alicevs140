# atomic_thread_fence Function
Acts as a *fence*—which is a memory synchronization primitive that enforces ordering between load/store operations—without an associated atomic operation.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
inline void atomic_thread_fence(  
   memory_order Order  
) _NOEXCEPT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Order`  
 A memory ordering constraint that determines fence type.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Order` argument determines fence type.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|`memory_order_relaxed`|The fence has no effect.|  
|`memory_order_consume`|The fence is an acquire fence.|  
|`memory_order_acquire`|The fence is an acquire fence.|  
|`memory_order_release`|The fence is a release fence.|  
|`memory_order_acq_rel`|The fence is both an acquire fence and a release fence.|  
|`memory_order_seq_cst`|The fence is both an acquire fence and a release fence, and is sequentially consistent.|  
  
## Requirements
