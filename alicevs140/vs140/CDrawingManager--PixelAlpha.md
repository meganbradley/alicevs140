# CDrawingManager::PixelAlpha
Calculates the final color for a semitransparent pixel.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
static COLORREF __stdcall PixelAlpha(  
   COLORREF srcPixel,  
   int percent  
);  
  
static COLORREF __stdcall PixelAlpha(  
   COLORREF srcPixel,  
   double percentR,  
   double percentG,  
   double percentB  
);  
  
static COLORREF __stdcall PixelAlpha(  
   COLORREF srcPixel,  
   COLORREF dstPixel,  
   int percent  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [in] `srcPixel`  
 The initial color for the pixel.  
  
 [in] `percent`  
 A number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of transparency. A value of 100 indicates that the initial color is completely transparent.  
  
 [in] `percentR`  
 A number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of transparency for the red component.  
  
 [in] `percentG`  
 A number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of transparency for the green component.  
  
 [in] `percentB`  
 A number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of transparency for the blue component.  
  
 [in] `dstPixel`  
 The base color for the pixel.  
  
## Return Value  
 The final color for the semitransparent pixel.  
  
## Remarks  
 This is a helper class for coloring semitransparent bitmaps and is not designed to be called directly by the programmer.  
  
 When you use the version of the method that has `dstPixel`, the final color is a combination of `dstPixel` and `srcPixel`. The `srcPixel` color is the partially transparent color over the base color of `dstPixel`.
