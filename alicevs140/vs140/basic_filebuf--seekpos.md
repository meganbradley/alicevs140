# basic_filebuf::seekpos
Tries to alter the current positions for the controlled streams.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual pos  
      _  
      type seekpos(  
   pos_type _Sp,  
   ios_base::openmode _Which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Sp`  
 The position to seek for.  
  
 `_Which`  
 Specifies the mode for the pointer position. The default is to allow you to modify the read and write positions.  
  
## Return Value  
 If the file pointer **fp** is a null pointer, the function fails. Otherwise, it endeavors to alter the stream position by calling `fsetpos`(**fp**, **&fposn**), where **fposn** is the `fpos_t` object stored in `pos`. If that function succeeds, the function returns `pos`. Otherwise, it returns an invalid stream position. To determine if the stream position is invalid, compare the return value with `pos_type(off_type(-1))`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The protected virtual member function endeavors to alter the current positions for the controlled streams. For an object of class [basic_filebuf](../vs140/basic_filebuf-Class.md)<**Elem**, **Tr**>, a stream position can be represented by an object of type `fpos_t`, which stores an offset and any state information needed to parse a wide stream. Offset zero designates the first element of the stream. (An object of type `pos_type` stores at least an `fpos_t` object.)  
  
 For a file opened for both reading and writing, both the input and output streams are positioned in tandem. To switch between inserting and extracting, you must call either [pubseekoff](../vs140/basic_streambuf--pubseekoff.md) or [pubseekpos](../vs140/basic_streambuf--pubseekpos.md). Calls to `pubseekoff` (and hence to `seekoff`) have various limitations for text streams, binary streams, and wide streams.  
  
 For a wide stream, if any insertions have occurred since the stream was opened, or since the last call to `streampos`, the function calls [overflow](../vs140/basic_filebuf--overflow.md). It also inserts any sequence needed to restore the initial conversion state, by using the file conversion facet **fac** to call **fac**`.``unshift` as needed. Each element **byte** of type `char` thus produced is written to the associated stream designated by the file pointer **fp** as if by successive calls of the form `fputc`(**byte**, **fp**). If the call to **fac.unshift** or any write fails, the function does not succeed.
