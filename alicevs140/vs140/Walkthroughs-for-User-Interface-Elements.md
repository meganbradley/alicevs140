# Walkthroughs for User Interface Elements
You can add menus and toolbars to many different user interface (UI) elements of your VSPackage or the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). The walkthroughs in this section lead you through the most common scenarios.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Creating a Top Level Menu](../vs140/Adding-a-Menu-to-the-Visual-Studio-Menu-Bar.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a menu from a VSPackage to the same level as the top level menu items of the IDE (such as **File**, **Edit**, **Help**).  
  
 [Creating a Cascading Submenu](../vs140/Adding-a-Submenu-to-a-Menu.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a submenu to an existing menu.  
  
 [Creating an MRU Menu List](../vs140/Adding-a-Most-Recently-Used-List-to-a-Submenu.md)  
 Demonstrates how to support a dynamic menu list in a submenu that is the basis of a Most Recently Used (MRU) menu.  
  
 [Adding a Toolbar to the IDE](../vs140/Adding-a-Toolbar.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a toolbar to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE.  
  
 [Adding a Toolbar to a Tool Window](../vs140/Adding-a-Toolbar-to-a-Tool-Window.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a toolbar to a tool window.  
  
 [Adding a Menu Controller to a Toolbar](../vs140/Adding-a-Menu-Controller-to-a-Toolbar.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a menu controller to a toolbar. A menu controller is a button that contains a default command and an arrow that reveals a drop down menu list where additional commands can be selected.

 Demonstrates how to add a context (that is, right-click) menu to a tool window. In this case, a gradient service tool window.
