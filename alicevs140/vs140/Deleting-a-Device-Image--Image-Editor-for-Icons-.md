# Deleting a Device Image (Image Editor for Icons)
### To delete a device image  
  
1.  While the icon image is displayed in the **Image** editor, select **Delete Device Image** from the **Image** menu. When you delete the last icon image in the resource, the resource is also deleted.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When you press the DEL key, the images and colors you have drawn on an icon are deleted but the icon remains; you can now redesign it. If you press DEL by mistake, you can press CTRL+Z to undo the action.
