# hash_set::equal_range
> [!NOTE]
>  This API is obsolete. The alternative is [unordered_set Class](../vs140/unordered_set-Class.md).  
  
 Returns a pair of iterators respectively to the first element in a hash set with a key that is equal to a specified key and to the first element in the hash set with a key that is greater than the key.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      pair <const_iterator, const_iterator> equal_range (  
   const Key& _Key  
) const;  
pair <iterator, iterator> equal_range (  
   const Key& _Key  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Key`  
 The argument key to be compared with the sort key of an element from the hash_set being searched.  
  
## Return Value  
 A pair of iterators where the first is the [lower_bound](../vs140/set--lower_bound.md) of the key and the second is the [upper_bound](../vs140/set--upper_bound.md) of the key.  
  
 To access the first iterator of a pair pr returned by the member function, use `pr`.**first**, and to dereference the lower bound iterator, use \*(`pr`.**first**). To access the second iterator of a pair `pr` returned by the member function, use `pr`.**second**, and to dereference the upper bound iterator, use \*(`pr`.**second**).  
  
## Remarks  
 In Visual C++ .NET 2003, members of the [<hash_map>](../vs140/-hash_map-.md) and [<hash_set>](../vs140/-hash_set-.md) header files are no longer in the std namespace, but rather have been moved into the stdext namespace. See [The stdext Namespace](../vs140/stdext-Namespace.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// hash_set_equal_range.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <hash_set>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;   
   using namespace stdext;  
   typedef hash_set<int> IntHSet;  
   IntHSet hs1;  
   hash_set <int> :: const_iterator hs1_RcIter;  
  
   hs1.insert( 10 );  
   hs1.insert( 20 );  
   hs1.insert( 30 );  
  
   pair <IntHSet::const_iterator, IntHSet::const_iterator> p1, p2;  
   p1 = hs1.equal_range( 20 );  
  
   cout << "The upper bound of the element with "  
        << "a key of 20 in the hash_set hs1 is: "  
        << *(p1.second) << "." << endl;  
  
   cout << "The lower bound of the element with "  
        << "a key of 20 in the hash_set hs1 is: "  
        << *(p1.first) << "." << endl;  
  
   // Compare the upper_bound called directly   
   hs1_RcIter = hs1.upper_bound( 20 );  
   cout << "A direct call of upper_bound( 20 ) gives "  
        << *hs1_RcIter << "," << endl  
        << "matching the 2nd element of the pair"  
        << " returned by equal_range( 20 )." << endl;  
  
   p2 = hs1.equal_range( 40 );  
  
   // If no match is found for the key,  
   // both elements of the pair return end( )  
   if ( ( p2.first == hs1.end( ) ) && ( p2.second == hs1.end( ) ) )  
      cout << "The hash_set hs1 doesn't have an element "  
           << "with a key greater than or equal to 40." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The element of hash_set hs1 with a key >= 40 is: "  
           << *(p1.first) << "." << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The upper bound of the element with a key of 20 in the hash_set hs1 is: 30.**  
**The lower bound of the element with a key of 20 in the hash_set hs1 is: 20.**  
**A direct call of upper_bound( 20 ) gives 30,**  
**matching the 2nd element of the pair returned by equal_range( 20 ).**  
**The hash_set hs1 doesn't have an element with a key greater than or equal to 40.**   
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <hash_set>  
  
 **Namespace:** stdext
