-   [The main function and program execution](../vs140/main-Function-and-Program-Execution.md)  
  
-   [Parsing command-line arguments](../vs140/Parsing-C-Command-Line-Arguments.md)  
  
-   [Lifetime, scope, visibility, and linkage](../vs140/Lifetime--Scope--Visibility--and-Linkage.md)  
  
-   [Name spaces](../vs140/Name-Spaces.md)
