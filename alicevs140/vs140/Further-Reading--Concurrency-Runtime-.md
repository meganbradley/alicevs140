# Further Reading (Concurrency Runtime)
The following resources contain additional information about the Concurrency Runtime:  
  
-   The [Parallel Computing Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160570) on the MSDN Web site has links to the latest content and forum posts about parallel programming in native C++ and the .NET Framework.  
  
-   The [Parallel Programming in Native Code blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=183873) on the MSDN blog site contains many in-depth articles about parallel programming in the Concurrency Runtime.  
  
-   The [Parallel Computing in C++ and Native Code forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=183874) on the MSDN forums site is where to ask and answer questions about parallel programming in native code.  
  
-   The [Code samples for the Concurrency Runtime and Parallel Pattern Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=183875) page on the MSDN Code Gallery site contains many samples that demonstrate intermediate and advanced parallel programming techniques.  
  
-   The document [Parallel Programming in the .NET Framework](assetId:///4d83c690-ad2d-489e-a2e0-b85b898a672d) describes the parallel programming functionality that is provided by the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../vs140/includes/net_v40_long_md.md)].
