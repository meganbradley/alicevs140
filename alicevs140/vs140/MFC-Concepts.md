# MFC Concepts
This section provides conceptual and task-based topics to help you program using the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library.  
  
## In This Section  
 [General MFC Topics](../vs140/General-MFC-Topics.md)  
 Discusses the technical details of the MFC Library.  
  
 [Using CObject](../vs140/Using-CObject.md)  
 Provides links to using `CObject`, the base class for most classes in MFC.  
  
 [Collections](../vs140/Collections.md)  
 Discusses collection classes created from and not created from C++ templates.  
  
 [Date and Time](../vs140/Date-and-Time.md)  
 Provides links to topics discussing using date and time with MFC.  
  
 [Files](../vs140/Files-in-MFC.md)  
 Discusses `CFile` and how to handle files in MFC.  
  
 [Memory Management (MFC)](../vs140/Memory-Management.md)  
 Describes how to take advantage of the general-purpose services related to memory management.  
  
 [Message Handling and Mapping](../vs140/Message-Handling-and-Mapping.md)  
 Describes how messages and commands are processed by the MFC framework and how to connect them to their handler functions.  
  
 [Serialization](../vs140/Serialization-in-MFC.md)  
 Explains the serialization mechanism provided to allow objects to persist between runs of your program.  
  
 [Unicode](../vs140/Unicode-in-MFC.md)  
 Describes MFC support for the Unicode standard for encoding wide characters on Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP platforms.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Exception Handling (MFC)](../vs140/Exception-Handling-in-MFC.md)  
 Explains the exception-handling mechanisms available in MFC.  
  
 [MFC Internet Programming Basics](../vs140/MFC-Internet-Programming-Basics.md)  
 Discusses the MFC classes that support Internet programming.  
  
 [MFC Internet Programming Tasks](../vs140/MFC-Internet-Programming-Tasks.md)  
 Discusses how to add Internet support to your applications.  
  
 [MFC COM](../vs140/MFC-COM.md)  
 Discusses a subset of MFC, which is designed to support COM, while most of the Active Template Library (ATL) is designed for COM programming.  
  
 [Multithreading with C++ and MFC](../vs140/Multithreading-with-C---and-MFC.md)  
 Describes what processes and threads are and discusses the MFC approach to multithreading.  
  
 [Windows Sockets in MFC](../vs140/Windows-Sockets.md)  
 Covers the MFC implementation of Windows Sockets.  
  
 [MFC Reference](../vs140/MFC-Desktop-Applications.md)  
 Provides reference material for the MFC Library, a set of classes that constitute an application framework, which is the framework of an application written for the Windows API.  
  
 [MFC Samples](../vs140/Visual-C---Samples.md)  
 Provides links to samples that show how to use MFC in desktop applications, DLLs, database applications, controls, Web applications, and more.
