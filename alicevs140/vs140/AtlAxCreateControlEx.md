# AtlAxCreateControlEx
Creates an ActiveX control, initializes it, and hosts it in the specified window. An interface pointer and event sink for the new control can also be created.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This function cannot be used in applications that execute in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../vs140/includes/wrt_md.md)].  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      ATLAPI AtlAxCreateControlEx(  
LPCOLESTR lpszName,  
HWND hWnd,  
IStream* pStream,  
IUnknown** ppUnkContainer,  
IUnknown** ppUnkControl,  
REFIID iidSink = IID_NULL,  
IUnknown* punkSink = NULL  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpszName`  
 A pointer to a string to be passed to the control. Must be formatted in one of the following ways:  
  
-   A ProgID such as "MSCAL.Calendar.7"  
  
-   A CLSID such as "{8E27C92B-1264-101C-8A2F-040224009C02}"  
  
-   A URL such as "http://www.microsoft.com"  
  
-   A reference to an Active document such as "file://\\\Documents\MyDoc.doc"  
  
-   A fragment of HTML such as "MSHTML:<HTML\><BODY\>This is a line of text</BODY\></HTML\>"  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  "MSHTML:" must precede the HTML fragment so that it is designated as being an MSHTML stream.  
  
 `hWnd`  
 [in] Handle to the window that the control will be attached to.  
  
 `pStream`  
 [in] A pointer to a stream that is used to initialize the properties of the control. Can be **NULL**.  
  
 `ppUnkContainer`  
 [out] The address of a pointer that will receive the **IUnknown** of the container. Can be **NULL**.  
  
 `ppUnkControl`  
 [out] The address of a pointer that will receive the **IUnknown** of the created control. Can be **NULL**.  
  
 `iidSink`  
 The interface identifier of an outgoing interface on the contained object.  
  
 *punkSink*  
 A pointer to the **IUnknown** interface of the sink object to be connected to the connection point specified by `iidSink` on the contained object after the contained object has been successfully created.  
  
## Return Value  
 One of the standard HRESULT values.  
  
## Remarks  
 `AtlAxCreateControlEx` is similar to [AtlAxCreateControl](../vs140/AtlAxCreateControl.md) but also allows you to receive an interface pointer to the newly created control and set up an event sink to receive events fired by the control.  
  
 To create a licensed ActiveX control, see [AtlAxCreateControlLicEx](../vs140/AtlAxCreateControlLicEx.md).
