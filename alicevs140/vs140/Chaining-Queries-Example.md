# Chaining Queries Example
Visual Basic and C# share many common concepts, but with often subtle differences. Where previous versions of the documentation presented shared concepts in topics that covered both languages, the current documentation presents each language in it's own topic.

> [!NOTE]
>  The example uses the yield return construct of C#. Because there is no equivalent feature in Visual Basic, this example is provided only in C#.
