# C Declarations and Definitions
A "declaration" establishes an association between a particular variable, function, or type and its attributes. [Overview of Declarations](../vs140/Overview-of-Declarations.md) gives the ANSI syntax for the `declaration` nonterminal. A declaration also specifies where and when an identifier can be accessed (the "linkage" of an identifier). See [Lifetime, Scope, Visibility, and Linkage](../vs140/Lifetime--Scope--Visibility--and-Linkage.md) for information about linkage.  
  
 A "definition" of a variable establishes the same associations as a declaration but also causes storage to be allocated for the variable.  
  
 For example, the `main`, `find`, and `count` functions and the `var` and `val` variables are defined in one source file, in this order:  
  
```  
int main() {}  
  
int var = 0;  
double val[MAXVAL];  
char find( fileptr ) {}  
int count( double f ) {}  
```  
  
 The variables `var` and `val` can be used in the `find` and `count` functions; no further declarations are needed. But these names are not visible (cannot be accessed) in `main`.
