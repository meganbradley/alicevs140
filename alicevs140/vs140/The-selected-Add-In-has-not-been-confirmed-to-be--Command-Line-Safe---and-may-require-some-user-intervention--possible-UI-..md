# The selected Add-In has not been confirmed to be &#39;Command Line Safe&#39;, and may require some user intervention (possible UI).
This error generally occurs when an Add-in has been selected to be used from the Command prompt (DOS prompt) but the add-in does not list itself as safe for the command line. The add-in might display UI that could interfere with command line use.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  From the **Tools** menu, choose **Add-In Manager**.  
  
2.  In **the Add-In Manager** dialog box, clear **Command Line** for the add-in.
