# Support for ANSI
Most MFC classes and methods support the ANSI character set, although the MFC framework as a whole is gradually evolving toward supporting only the Unicode character set. Because of the ongoing enhancements in [!INCLUDE[windowsver](../vs140/includes/windowsver_md.md)] and Windows Common Controls version 6.1, support for several ANSI classes and methods is deprecated.  For more information, see [Deprecated ANSI APIs](../vs140/Deprecated-ANSI-APIs.md) and [Support for Unicode](../vs140/Support-for-Unicode.md).
