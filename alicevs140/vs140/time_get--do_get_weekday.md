# time_get::do_get_weekday
A protected virtual member function that is called to parse a string as the name of the day of the week.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual iter  
      _  
      type do  
      _  
      get  
      _  
      weekday(  
   iter_type _First,   
   iter_type _Last,  
   ios_base& _Iosbase,   
   ios_base::iostate& _State,   
   tm* _Pt  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_First`  
 Input iterator addressing the beginning of the sequence to be converted.  
  
 `_Last`  
 Input iterator addressing the end of the sequence to be converted.  
  
 `_Iosbase`  
 A format flag which when set indicates that the currency symbol is optional; otherwise, it is required.  
  
 `_State`  
 Sets the appropriate bitmask elements for the stream state according to whether the operations succeeded.  
  
 `_Pt`  
 A pointer to where the weekday information is to be stored.  
  
## Return Value  
 An input iterator addressing the first element beyond the input field.  
  
## Remarks  
 The virtual protected member function tries to match sequential elements beginning at `_First` in the sequence [`_First`, `_Last`) until it has recognized a complete, nonempty weekday input field. If successful, it converts this field to its equivalent value as the component **tm::tm_wday**, and stores the result in _*Pt*->**tm_wday**. It returns an iterator designating the first element beyond the weekday input field. Otherwise, the function sets `ios_base::failbit` in \_*State*. It returns an iterator designating the first element beyond any prefix of a valid weekday input field. In either case, if the return value equals `_Last`, the function sets `ios_base::eofbit` in \_*State*.  
  
 The weekday input field is a sequence that matches the longest of a set of locale-specific sequences, such as Sun, Sunday, Mon, Monday, and so on. The converted value is the number of days since Sunday.  
  
## Example  
 See the example for [get_weekday](../vs140/time_get--get_weekday.md), which calls `do_get_weekday`.
