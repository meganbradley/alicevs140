# Overviews (Performance Tools)
This section provides conceptual and terminology overviews for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools, which you can use to measure the performance characteristics of an application under development.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Performance Session Overview](../vs140/Performance-Session-Overview.md)  
 Learn the basics of performance profiling with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools.  
  
 [Performance Session Properties](../vs140/Performance-Session-Properties.md)  
 Describes the properties that can be used to configure a performance session.  
  
 [Understanding Sampling Data Values](../vs140/Understanding-Sampling-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the sampling profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Instrumentation Data Valuess](../vs140/Understanding-Instrumentation-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the instrumentation profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Memory Allocation and Object Lifetime Data Values in Profiling Tools](../vs140/Understanding-Memory-Allocation-and-Object-Lifetime-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the .NET memory profiling method.  
  
 [Understanding Resource Contention Data Values in Profiling Tools](../vs140/Understanding-Resource-Contention-Data-Values.md)  
 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the concurrency profiling method.  
  
 [Performance Explorer Window](../vs140/Performance-Explorer-Window.md)  
 Describes the window that is used to configure and start performance sessions.  
  
 [CPU and Windows Counters](../vs140/CPU-and-Windows-Counters.md)  
 Learn about the CPU and Windows performance counters that can provide additional performance data in a performance session.  
  
 [Profiling and Windows Vista Security](../vs140/Profiling-and-Windows-Vista-Security.md)  
 Learn the issues and steps that are required to collect sampling data and to profile cross-session applications on [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)].
