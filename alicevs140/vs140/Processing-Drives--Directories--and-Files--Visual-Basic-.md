# Processing Drives, Directories, and Files (Visual Basic)
You can use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] to process drives, folders, and files with the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object, which provides better performance and is easier to use than traditional methods such as the `FileOpen` and `Write` functions (although they are still available). The following sections discuss these methods in detail.  
  
## In This Section  
 [File Access with Visual Basic](../vs140/File-Access-with-Visual-Basic.md)  
 Discusses how to use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to work with files, drives, and folders.  
  
 [Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the FileSystem](../Topic/Basics%20of%20.NET%20Framework%20File%20I-O%20and%20the%20File%20System%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Provides an overview of file I/O concepts in the .NET Framework, including streams, isolated storage, file events, file attributes, and file access.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files Using .NET Framework Methods](../vs140/Walkthrough--Manipulating-Files-by-Using-.NET-Framework-Methods--Visual-Basic-.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] to manipulate files and folders.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files and Directories in Visual Basic](../vs140/Walkthrough--Manipulating-Files-and-Directories-in-Visual-Basic.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to manipulate files and folders.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Program Structure and Code Conventions](../vs140/Program-Structure-and-Code-Conventions--Visual-Basic-.md)  
 Provides guidelines for the physical structure and appearance of programs.
