# constexpr (C++)
The keyword `constexpr` was introduced in C++11 and improved in C++14. It means *constant expression*. Like `const`, it can be applied to variables so that a compiler error will be raised if any code attempts to modify the value. Unlike `const`, `constexpr` can also be applied to functions and class constructors. `constexpr` indicates that the value, or return value, is constant and, if possible, will be computed at compile time.  A `constexpr` integral value can be used wherever a const integer is required, such as in template arguments and array declarations. And when a value can be computed at compile time instead of run time, it can help your program can run faster and use less memory.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
constexpr  literal-type  identifier = constant-expression;constexpr  literal-type  identifier { constant-expression };constexpr literal-type identifier(params );constexpr ctor (params);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `params`  
 One or more parameters which must be a literal type (as listed below) and must itself be a constant expression.  
  
## Return Value  
 A constexpr variable or function must return one of the literal types, as listed below.  
  
## Literal types  
 To limit the complexity of computing compile time constants, and their potential impacts of compilation time, the C++14 standard requires that the types involved in constant expressions be restricted to literal types. A literal type is one whose layout can be determined at compile time. The following are the literal types:  
  
1.  void  
  
2.  scalar types  
  
3.  references  
  
4.  Arrays of void, scalar types or references  
  
5.  A class that has a trivial destructor, and one or more constexpr constructors that are not move or copy constructors. Additionally, all its non-static data members and base classes must be literal types and not volatile.  
  
## constexpr variables  
 The primary difference between const and constexpr variables is that the initialization of a const variable can be deferred until run time whereas a constexpr variable must be initialized at compile time.  All constexpr variables are const.  
  
```  
constexpr float x = 42.0;  
constexpr float y{108};  
constexpr float z = exp(5, 3);  
constexpr int i; // Error! Not initialized  
int j = 0;  
constexpr int k = j + 1; //Error! j not a constant expression  
```  
  
## constexpr functions  
 A `constexpr` function is one whose return value can be computed at compile when consuming code requires it.  A `constexpr` function must accept and return only literal types. When its arguments are `constexpr` values, and consuming code requires the return value at compile time, for example to initialize a `constexpr` variable or provide a non-type template argument, it produces a compile-time constant. When called with non-`constexpr` arguments, or when its value is not required at compile-time, it produces a value at run time like a regular function.  (This dual behavior saves you from having to write `constexpr` and non-`constexpr` versions of the same function.)  
  
```  
constexpr float exp(float x, int n)  
{  
    return n == 0 ? 1 :  
        n % 2 == 0 ? exp(x * x, n / 2) :  
        exp(x * x, (n - 1) / 2) * x;  
};  
```  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Note: In the Visual Studio debugger, you can tell whether a `constexpr` function is being evaluated at compile time by putting a breakpoint inside it. If the breakpoint is hit, the function was called at run-time.  If not, then the function was called at compile time.  
  
## General constexpr rules  
 For a function, variable, constructor or static data member to be defined as `constexpr`, it must meet certain requirements:  
  
-   A `constexpr` function can be recursive. It cannot be [virtual](../vs140/virtual--C---.md), and its return type and parameter types must all be literal types. The body can be defined as `= default` or `= delete`. Otherwise it must follow these rules: it contains no `goto` statements, try blocks, unitialized variables, or variable definitions that are not literal types, or that are static or thread-local. Additionally, a constructor cannot be defined as constexpr if the enclosing class has any virtual base classes.  
  
-   A variable can be declared with `constexpr`, if it has a literal type and is initialized. If the initialization is performed by a constructor, the constructor must be declared as `constexpr`.  
  
-   A reference may be declared as constexpr if the object that it references has been initialized by a constant expression and any implicit conversions that are invoked during initialization are also constant expressions.  
  
-   All declarations of a `constexpr` variable or function must have the `constexpr` specifier.  
  
-   An explicit specialization of a non-constexpr template can be declared as `constexpr`:  
  
-   An explicit specialization of a `constexpr` template does not have to also be `constexpr`:  
  
-   A `constexpr` function or constructor is implicitly `inline`.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows `constexpr` variables, functions and a user-defined type. Note that in the last statement in main(), the `constexpr` member function GetValue() is a run-time call because the value is not required to be known at compile time.  
  
```  
#include <iostream>  
  
using namespace std;  
  
// Pass by value   
constexpr float exp(float x, int n)  
{  
    return n == 0 ? 1 :  
        n % 2 == 0 ? exp(x * x, n / 2) :  
        exp(x * x, (n - 1) / 2) * x;  
};  
  
// Pass by reference  
constexpr float exp2(const float& x, const int& n)  
{  
    return n == 0 ? 1 :  
        n % 2 == 0 ? exp2(x * x, n / 2) :  
        exp2(x * x, (n - 1) / 2) * x;  
};  
  
// Compile time computation of array length  
template<typename T, int N>  
constexpr int length(const T(&ary)[N])   
{   
    return N;   
}   
  
// Recursive constexpr function  
constexpr int fac(int n)  
{   
    return n == 1 ? 1 : n*fac(n - 1);   
}  
  
// User-defined type  
class Foo  
{  
public:  
    constexpr explicit Foo(int i) : _i(i) {}  
    constexpr int GetValue()  
    {  
        return _i;  
    }  
private:  
    int _i;  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
    //foo is const:  
    constexpr Foo foo(5);   
    // foo = Foo(6); //Error!  
  
    //Compile time:  
    constexpr float x = exp(5, 3);   
    constexpr float y { exp(2, 5) };  
    constexpr int val = foo.GetValue();   
    constexpr int f5 = fac(5);  
    const int nums[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };  
    const int nums2[length(nums) * 2] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };  
  
    //Run time:   
    cout << "The value of foo is " << foo.GetValue() << endl;   
  
}  
  
```
