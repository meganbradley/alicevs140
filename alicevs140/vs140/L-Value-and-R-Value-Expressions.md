# L-Value and R-Value Expressions
Expressions that refer to memory locations are called "l-value" expressions. An l-value represents a storage region's "locator" value, or a "left" value, implying that it can appear on the left of the equal sign (**=**). L-values are often identifiers.  
  
 Expressions referring to modifiable locations are called "modifiable l-values." A modifiable l-value cannot have an array type, an incomplete type, or a type with the **const** attribute. For structures and unions to be modifiable l-values, they must not have any members with the **const** attribute. The name of the identifier denotes a storage location, while the value of the variable is the value stored at that location.  
  
 An identifier is a modifiable l-value if it refers to a memory location and if its type is arithmetic, structure, union, or pointer. For example, if `ptr` is a pointer to a storage region, then `*ptr` is a modifiable l-value that designates the storage region to which `ptr` points.  
  
 Any of the following C expressions can be l-value expressions:  
  
-   An identifier of integral, floating, pointer, structure, or union type  
  
-   A subscript (**[ ]**) expression that does not evaluate to an array  
  
-   A member-selection expression (**â€“>** or **.**)  
  
-   A unary-indirection (**\***) expression that does not refer to an array  
  
-   An l-value expression in parentheses  
  
-   A **const** object (a nonmodifiable l-value)  
  
 The term "r-value" is sometimes used to describe the value of an expression and to distinguish it from an l-value. All l-values are r-values but not all r-values are l-values.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Microsoft C includes an extension to the ANSI C standard that allows casts of l-values to be used as l-values, as long as the size of the object is not lengthened through the cast. (See [Type-Cast Conversions](../vs140/Type-Cast-Conversions.md) for more information.) The following example illustrates this feature:  
  
```  
char *p ;  
short  i;  
long l;  
  
(long *) p = &l ;       /* Legal cast   */  
(long) i = l ;          /* Illegal cast */  
```  
  
 The default for Microsoft C is that the Microsoft extensions are enabled. Use the /Za compiler option to disable these extensions.
