# How to: Create a Profiling Tools ETW Report
The Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) report lists the ETW events that are recorded in a performance session of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools. ETW data is collected in a binary (.etl) file. For more information about this report, see [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) Report](../vs140/Event-Tracing-for-Windows--ETW--Report.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot display ETW reports in the interface for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
-   For information about how to collect ETW data by using the interface for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], see [How to: Collect Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) Data](../vs140/How-to--Collect-Event-Tracing-for-Windows--ETW--Data.md).  
  
-   For information about how to collect ETW data from a command prompt, see [VSPerfCmd](../vs140/VSPerfCmd.md) and [Events](../vs140/Events--VSPerfCmd-.md).  
  
 You generate the ETW report by using the **VSReport/summary:etw** command. The .etl that contains the ETW data must be in the same directory as the profiling data (.vsp or .vsps) file. By default, the report is generated as a comma-separated value (.csv) file. For more information, see [VSReport](../vs140/VSPerfReport.md).  
  
### To generate an ETW report  
  
-   In a **Command Prompt** window, type the following command line:  
  
     *ToolsPath* **VSPerfReport** *VSPFile*  **/Summary:ETW [/Xml]**  
  
    |||  
    |-|-|  
    |*ToolsPath*|The path of the Profiling Tools utility. For more information, see [Specifying the Path to Profiling Tools Command Line Tools](../vs140/Specifying-the-Path-to-Profiling-Tools-Command-Line-Tools.md).|  
    |*VSPFile*|The profiling data (.vsp or .vsps) file. Full and partial paths are accepted.|  
    |Xml|Generates a report that is formatted in XML.|
