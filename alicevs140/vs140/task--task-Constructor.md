# task::task Constructor
Constructs a `task` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
task();  
  
template<  
   typename _Ty  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) explicit task(_Ty _Param);  
  
template<  
   typename _Ty  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) explicit task(_Ty _Param, const task_options& _TaskOptions);  
  
task(  
   const task& _Other  
);  
  
task(  
   task&& _Other  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Ty`  
 The type of the parameter from which the task is to be constructed.  
  
 `_Param`  
 The parameter from which the task is to be constructed. This could be a lambda, a function object, a `task_completion_event<result_type>` object, or a Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo if you are using tasks in your Windows Store app. The lambda or function object should be a type equivalent to `std::function<X(void)>`, where X can be a variable of type `result_type`, `task<result_type>`, or a Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo in Windows Store apps.  
  
 `_TaskOptions`  
 The task options include cancellation token, scheduler etc  
  
 `_Other`  
 The source `task` object.  
  
## Remarks  
 The default constructor for a `task` is only present in order to allow tasks to be used within containers. A default constructed task cannot be used until you assign a valid task to it. Methods such as `get`, `wait` or `then` will throw an [invalid_argument](../vs140/invalid_argument-Class.md) exception when called on a default constructed task.  
  
 A task that is created from a `task_completion_event` will complete (and have its continuations scheduled) when the task completion event is set.  
  
 The version of the constructor that takes a cancellation token creates a task that can be canceled using the `cancellation_token_source` the token was obtained from. Tasks created without a cancellation token are not cancelable.  
  
 Tasks created from a `Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo` interface or a lambda that returns an `IAsyncInfo` interface reach their terminal state when the enclosed Windows Runtime asynchronous operation or action completes. Similarly, tasks created from a lamda that returns a `task<result_type>` reach their terminal state when the inner task reaches its terminal state, and not when the lamda returns.  
  
 `task` behaves like a smart pointer and is safe to pass around by value. It can be accessed by multiple threads without the need for locks.  
  
 The constructor overloads that take a Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo interface or a lambda returning such an interface, are only available to Windows Store apps.
