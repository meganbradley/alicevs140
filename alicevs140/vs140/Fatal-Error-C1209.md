# Fatal Error C1209
Friend assemblies not supported by the version of the runtime installed  
  
 C1208 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.  
  
 Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.  
  
 To resolve C1209, install the common language runtime that shipped with the compiler you are using.  
  
 For more information, see [Friend Assemblies](../Topic/Friend%20Assemblies%20\(C++\).md).
