# Native and .NET Interoperability
Visual C++ supports interoperability features that allow managed and unmanaged constructs to co-exist and interoperate within the same assembly, and even in the same file. A small subset of this functionality, such as P/Invoke, is supported by other .NET languages as well, but most of the interoperability support provided by Visual C++ is not available in other languages.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Mixed Assemblies in C++](../vs140/Mixed--Native-and-Managed--Assemblies.md)  
 Describes assemblies generated with the [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../Topic/-clr%20\(Common%20Language%20Runtime%20Compilation\).md) compiler option that contain both managed and unmanaged functionality.  
  
 [Using Windows Forms in MFC](../vs140/Using-a-Windows-Form-User-Control-in-MFC.md)  
 Discusses how to use the MFC Windows Forms support classes to host Windows Forms controls within your MFC applications.  
  
 [Platform Invocation Services](../vs140/Calling-Native-Functions-from-Managed-Code.md)  
 Describes how non-CLR DLLs can be used from .NET applications.
