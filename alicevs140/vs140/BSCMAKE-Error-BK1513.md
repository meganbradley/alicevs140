# BSCMAKE Error BK1513
nonincremental update requires all .SBR files  
  
 BSCMAKE cannot build a new browse information (.bsc) file because one or more .sbr files are truncated. To find the names of the truncated .sbr files, read the [BK4502](../vs140/BSCMAKE-Warning-BK4502.md) warnings that accompany this error.  
  
 BSCMAKE can update a .bsc file with a truncated .sbr file but cannot build a new one. BSCMAKE may build a new .bsc file for the following reasons:  
  
-   Missing .bsc file.  
  
-   Wrong filename specified for .bsc file.  
  
-   Corrupted .bsc file.  
  
 To resolve this issue, delete the truncated .sbr files and rebuild, or clean the solution and rebuild. (In the IDE, choose **Build**, **Clean Solution**, and then choose **Build**, **Rebuild Solution**.)
