# Elementary Data Types (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] supplies a set of predefined data types, which you can use for many of your programming elements. This section describes these types and how to use them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Every elementary data type in Visual Basic is supported by a structure or a class that is in the <xref:System?qualifyHint=False> namespace. The compiler uses each data type keyword as an alias for the underlying structure or class. For example, declaring a variable by using the reserved word `Byte` is the same as declaring it by using the fully qualified structure name <xref:System.Byte?qualifyHint=True>.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Numeric Data Types](../vs140/Numeric-Data-Types--Visual-Basic-.md)  
 Describes the integral and non-integral numeric types.  
  
 [Character Data Types](../vs140/Character-Data-Types--Visual-Basic-.md)  
 Describes the `Char` and `String` types.  
  
 [Miscellaneous Data Types](../Topic/Miscellaneous%20Data%20Types%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Describes the `Boolean`, `Date`, and `Object` types.
