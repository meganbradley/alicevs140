# How to: Use the WPF Tree Visualizer
You can use the WPF Tree visualizer to explore the visual tree of a WPF object, and to view the WPF dependency properties for the objects that are contained in that tree. For more information about visual trees, see [Trees in WPF](assetId:///e83f25e5-d66b-4fc7-92d2-50130c9a6649). For more information about dependency properties, see [Dependency Properties Overview](assetId:///d119d00c-3afb-48d6-87a0-c4da4f83dee5).  
  
 When you open the WPF Tree visualizer, you will see two panes: the **Visual Tree** on the left and the **Properties of** *Name***:***Type* pane on the right. Select any object in the **Visual Tree** pane, and the **Properties of** *Name***:***Type* pane is automatically updated to show the properties for that object.  
  
### To open the WPF Tree visualizer  
  
1.  In a DataTip, **Watch** window, **Autos** window, or **Locals** window, next to a WPF object name, click the arrow adjacent to the magnifying glass icon.  
  
     A list of visualizers is displayed.  
  
2.  Click **WPF Tree Visualizer**.  
  
### To search the visual tree  
  
-   In the **Visual Tree** pane, type the string you want to search for in the **Search** box.  
  
     The WPF Tree visualizer immediately finds the first object in the visual tree that matches the string you have typed. Type more characters to find a more accurate match.  
  
    -   To go to the next match within the visual tree, click **Next**.  
  
    -   To go back to the previous match, click **Prev**.  
  
    -   To clear the search criteria, click **Clear**.  
  
### To search the properties list  
  
-   In the **Properties of** *Name***:***Type* pane, type the string your want to search for in the **Filter** box.  
  
     The WPF Tree visualizer immediately finds the properties that match the string you have typed; now, the list displays only those properties matching the string you have typed. Type more characters to find a more-accurate match.  
  
    -   To clear the search criteria, click **Clear**.  
  
### To close the visualizer  
  
-   Click the **Close** icon in the upper-right corner of the dialog box.
