# Using CMonthCalCtrl
The month calendar control ([CMonthCalCtrl](../vs140/CMonthCalCtrl-Class.md)) implements a calendar-like user interface. This provides the user with a very intuitive and recognizable method of entering or selecting a date. The control also provides the application with the means to obtain and set the date information in the control using existing data types. By default, the month calendar control displays the current day and month. However, the user is able to scroll to the previous and next months and select a specific month and/or year.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use the `CMonthCalCtrl` class in your project, you must include AFXDTCTL.H, usually in STDAFX.H.
