# Storage of Bit Fields
**ANSI 3.5.2.1** The order of allocation of bit fields within an int  
  
 Bit fields are allocated within an integer from least-significant to most-significant bit. In the following code  
  
```  
struct mybitfields  
{  
   unsigned a : 4;  
   unsigned b : 5;  
   unsigned c : 7;  
} test;  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   test.a = 2;  
   test.b = 31;  
   test.c = 0;  
}  
```  
  
 the bits would be arranged as follows:  
  
```  
00000001 11110010  
cccccccb bbbbaaaa  
```  
  
 Since the 80x86 processors store the low byte of integer values before the high byte, the integer 0x01F2 above would be stored in physical memory as 0xF2 followed by 0x01.
