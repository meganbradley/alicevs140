# Compiler Error C3851
'char': a universal-character-name cannot designate a character in the basic character set  
  
 In code compiled as C++, you cannot use a universal character name that represents a character in the basic source character set outside of a string or character literal. For more information, see [Character Sets](../vs140/Character-Sets2.md). In code compiled as C, you cannot use a universal character name for characters in the range 0x20-0x7f, inclusive, except for 0x24 ('$'), 0x40 ('@'), or 0x60 ('`').  
  
 The following samples generate C3851, and show how to fix it:  
  
```cpp  
// C3851.cpp  
int main()  
{  
   int test1_\u0041 = 0;   // C3851, \u0041 = 'A' in basic character set  
   int test2_A = 0;        // OK  
}  
```
