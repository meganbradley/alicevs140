# Create models for your app
Modeling diagrams help you understand, clarify, and communicate ideas about your code and the user requirements that your software system must support. For example, to describe and communicate user requirements, you can use Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case, activity, class, and sequence diagrams. To describe and communicate the functionality of your system, you can use UML component, class, activity, and sequence diagrams.  
  
 See [Channel 9 Video: Improve architecture through modeling](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252078).  
  
 You can create the following UML diagrams in this release:  
  
|**Diagram**|**Shows**|  
|-----------------|---------------|  
|[UML Activity Diagrams: Introduction](../vs140/UML-Activity-Diagrams--Reference.md)|Flow of work between actions and participants in a business process|  
|[UML Component Diagrams: Introduction](../vs140/UML-Component-Diagrams--Reference.md)|Components of a system, their interfaces, ports, and relationships|  
|[UML Class Diagrams: Introduction](../vs140/UML-Class-Diagrams--Reference.md)|Types that are used to store and exchange data in the system and their relationships|  
|[UML Sequence Diagrams: Introduction](../vs140/UML-Sequence-Diagrams--Reference.md)|Sequences of interactions between objects, components, systems, or actors|  
|[UML Use Case Diagrams: Introduction](../vs140/UML-Use-Case-Diagrams--Reference.md)|User goals and tasks that a system supports|  
  
 To see which versions of Visual Studio support each type of diagram, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../vs140/What-s-new-for-design-in-Visual-Studio.md#VersionSupport).  
  
 To visualize the architecture of a system or existing code, create the following diagrams:  
  
|**Diagram**|**Shows**|  
|-----------------|---------------|  
|[Layer Diagrams: Guidelines](../vs140/Layer-Diagrams--Guidelines.md)<br /><br /> [Layer Diagrams: Reference](../vs140/Layer-Diagrams--Reference.md)|High-level architecture of the system|  
|Code maps<br /><br /> [Map dependencies across your code](../vs140/Map-dependencies-across-your-solutions.md)<br /><br /> [Find potential problems in code using code maps](../vs140/Find-potential-problems-using-code-map-analyzers.md)|Dependencies and other relationships in existing code|  
|Code-generated class diagrams<br /><br /> [Working with Class Diagrams](../vs140/Working-with-Class-Diagrams--Class-Designer-.md)|Types and their relationships in .NET code|
