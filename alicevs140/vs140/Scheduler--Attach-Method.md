# Scheduler::Attach Method
Attaches the scheduler to the calling context. After this method returns, the calling context is managed by the scheduler and the scheduler becomes the current scheduler.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual void Attach() =0;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Attaching a scheduler implicitly places a reference on the scheduler.  
  
 At some point in the future, you must call the [CurrentScheduler::Detach](../vs140/CurrentScheduler--Detach-Method.md) method in order to allow the scheduler to shut down.  
  
 If this method is called from a context that is already attached to a different scheduler, the existing scheduler is remembered as the previous scheduler, and the newly created scheduler becomes the current scheduler. When you call the `CurrentScheduler::Detach` method at a later point, the previous scheduler is restored as the current scheduler.  
  
 This method will throw an [improper_scheduler_attach](../vs140/improper_scheduler_attach-Class.md) exception if this scheduler is the current scheduler of the calling context.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** concrt.h
