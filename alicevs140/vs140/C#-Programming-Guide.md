# C# Programming Guide
This section provides detailed information on key C# language features and features accessible to C# through the .NET Framework.  
  
 Most of this section assumes that you already know something about C# and general programming concepts. If you are a complete beginner with programming or with C#, you might want to visit the [C# Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=95125), where you can find many tutorials, samples and videos to help you get started.  
  
 For information about specific keywords, operators and preprocessor directives, see [C# Reference](../vs140/C#-Reference.md). For information about the C# Language Specification, see [C# Language Specification](../vs140/C#-Language-Specification.md).
