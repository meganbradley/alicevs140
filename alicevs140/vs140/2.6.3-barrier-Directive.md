# 2.6.3 barrier Directive
The **barrier** directive synchronizes all the threads in a team. When encountered, each thread in the team waits until all of the others have reached this point. The syntax of the **barrier** directive is as follows:  
  
```  
#pragma omp barrier new-line  
```  
  
 After all threads in the team have encountered the barrier, each thread in the team begins executing the statements after the barrier directive in parallel. Note that because the **barrier** directive does not have a C language statement as part of its syntax, there are some restrictions on its placement within a program. See [Appendix C](../vs140/C.-OpenMP-C-and-C---Grammar.md) for the formal grammar. The example below illustrates these restrictions.  
  
```  
/* ERROR - The barrier directive cannot be the immediate  
*          substatement of an if statement  
*/  
if (x!=0)  
   #pragma omp barrier  
...  
  
/* OK - The barrier directive is enclosed in a  
*      compound statement.  
*/  
if (x!=0) {  
   #pragma omp barrier  
}  
```
