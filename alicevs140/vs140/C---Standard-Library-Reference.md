# C++ Standard Library Reference
A C++ program can call on a large number of functions from this conforming implementation of the Standard C++ Library. These functions perform essential services such as input and output and provide efficient implementations of frequently used operations.  
  
 For more information about Visual C++ run-time libraries, see [C Run-Time Libraries](../vs140/CRT-Library-Features.md).
