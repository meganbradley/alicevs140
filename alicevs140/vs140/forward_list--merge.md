# forward_list::merge
Combines two sorted sequences into a single sorted sequence in linear time. Removes the elements from the argument list, and inserts them into this `forward_list`. The two lists should be sorted by the same compare function object before the call to `merge`. The combined list will be sorted by that compare function object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void merge(forward_list& _Right);  
template<class Predicate>  
    void merge(forward_list& _Right, Predicate _Comp);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`_Right`|The forward list to merge from.|  
|`_Comp`|The compare function object that is used to sort elements.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `forward_list::merge` removes the elements from the `forward_list``_Right``,` and inserts them into this `forward_list`. Both sequences must be ordered by the same predicate, described below. The combined sequence is also ordered by that compare function object.  
  
 For the iterators `Pi` and `Pj` designating elements at positions `i` and `j`, the first member function imposes the order `!(*Pj < *Pi)` whenever `i < j`. (The elements are sorted in `ascending` order.) The second member function imposes the order `!_Comp(*Pj, *Pi)` whenever `i < j`.  
  
 No pairs of elements in the original controlled sequence are reversed in the resulting controlled sequence. If a pair of elements in the resulting controlled sequence compares equal (`!(*Pi < *Pj) && !(*Pj < *Pi)`), an element from the original controlled sequence appears before an element from the sequence controlled by `_Right`.  
  
 An exception occurs only if `_Comp` throws an exception. In that case, the controlled sequence is left in unspecified order and the exception is rethrown.
