# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException
An <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException?qualifyHint=False> exception is generated when a warning or error is returned by an OLE DB data source.  
  
## Associated Tips  
 **Verify that you are connecting with valid credentials.**  
 Make sure that the credentials you are supplying are valid. For more information, see <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbErrorCollection?qualifyHint=False>.  
  
 **Verify that the server name is correct and that the server is running.**  
 Make sure that you are using the correct server name, and that the server can be reached. For more information, see <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbErrorCollection?qualifyHint=False>.  
  
### Remarks  
 This exception is thrown whenever the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB encounters an error generated by the server.  
  
 If the severity of the error is too great, the server may close the <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection?qualifyHint=False>. However, the user can reopen the connection and continue.
