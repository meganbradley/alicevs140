# CComControlBase::m_spDataAdviseHolder
Provides a standard means to hold advisory connections between data objects and advise sinks.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CComPtr<IDataAdviseHolder> m_spDataAdviseHolder;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use this data member within your control class, you must declare it as a data member in your control class. Your control class will not inherit this data member from the base class because it is declared within a union in the base class.  
  
 A data object is a control that can transfer data and that implements [IDataObject](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms688421), whose methods specify the format and transfer medium of the data.  
  
 The interface `m_spDataAdviseHolder` implements the [IDataObject::DAdvise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692579) and [IDataObject::DUnadvise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692448) methods to establish and delete advisory connections to the container. The control's container must implement an advise sink by supporting the [IAdviseSink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692513) interface.
