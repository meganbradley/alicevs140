# CDaoRecordset::Seek
Call this member function to locate the record in an indexed table-type recordset object that satisfies the specified criteria for the current index and make that record the current record.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL Seek(  
   LPCTSTR lpszComparison,  
   COleVariant* pKey1,  
   COleVariant* pKey2 = NULL,  
   COleVariant* pKey3 = NULL   
);  
BOOL Seek(  
   LPCTSTR lpszComparison,  
   COleVariant* pKeyArray,  
   WORD nKeys   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpszComparison`  
 One of the following string expressions: "<", "<=", "=", ">=", or ">".  
  
 `pKey1`  
 A pointer to a [COleVariant](../vs140/COleVariant-Class.md) whose value corresponds to the first field in the index. Required.  
  
 *pKey2*  
 A pointer to a `COleVariant` whose value corresponds to the second field in the index, if any. Defaults to **NULL**.  
  
 *pKey3*  
 A pointer to a `COleVariant` whose value corresponds to the third field in the index, if any. Defaults to **NULL**.  
  
 *pKeyArray*  
 A pointer to an array of variants. The array size corresponds to the number of fields in the index.  
  
 *nKeys*  
 An integer corresponding to the size of the array, which is the number of fields in the index.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Do not specify wildcards in the keys. Wildcards will cause `Seek` to return no matching records.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if matching records are found, otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use the second (array) version of `Seek` to handle indexes of four fields or more.  
  
 `Seek` enables high-performance index searching on table-type recordsets. You must set the current index by calling `SetCurrentIndex` before calling `Seek`. If the index identifies a nonunique key field or fields, `Seek` locates the first record that satisfies the criteria. If you do not set an index, an exception is thrown.  
  
 Note that if you are not creating a UNICODE recordset, the `COleVariant` objects must be explicitly declared ANSI. This can be done by using the [COleVariant::COleVariant](../vs140/COleVariant--COleVariant.md)**(** `lpszSrc`**,** `vtSrc` **)** form of constructor with `vtSrc` set to `VT_BSTRT` (ANSI) or by using the **COleVariant** function [SetString](../vs140/COleVariant--SetString.md)**(** `lpszSrc`**,** `vtSrc` **)** with `vtSrc` set to `VT_BSTRT`.  
  
 When you call `Seek`, you pass one or more key values and a comparison operator ("<", "<=", "=", ">=", or ">"). `Seek` searches through the specified key fields and locates the first record that satisfies the criteria specified by `lpszComparison` and `pKey1`. Once found, `Seek` returns nonzero, and makes that record current. If `Seek` fails to locate a match, `Seek` returns zero, and the current record is undefined. When using DAO directly, you must explicitly check the NoMatch property.  
  
 If `lpszComparison` is "=", ">=", or ">", `Seek` starts at the beginning of the index. If `lpszComparison` is "<" or "<=", `Seek` starts at the end of the index and searches backward unless there are duplicate index entries at the end. In this case, `Seek` starts at an arbitrary entry among the duplicate index entries at the end of the index.  
  
 There does not have to be a current record when you use `Seek`.  
  
 To locate a record in a dynaset-type or snapshot-type recordset that satisfies a specific condition, use the Find operations. To include all records, not just those that satisfy a specific condition, use the Move operations to move from record to record.  
  
 You cannot call `Seek` on an attached table of any type because attached tables must be opened as dynaset-type or snapshot-type recordsets. However, if you call `CDaoDatabase::Open` to directly open an installable ISAM database, you can call `Seek` on tables in that database, although the performance may be slow.
