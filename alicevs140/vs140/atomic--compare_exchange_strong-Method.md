# atomic::compare_exchange_strong Method
Performs an *atomic compare and exchange* operation on `*this`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
bool compare_exchange_strong(  
   Ty& Exp,  
   Ty Value,  
   memory_order Order1,  
   memory_order Order2  
) volatile _NOEXCEPT;  
bool compare_exchange_strong(  
   Ty& Exp,  
   Ty Value,  
   memory_order Order1,  
   memory_order Order2  
) _NOEXCEPT;  
bool compare_exchange_strong(  
   Ty& Exp,  
   Ty Value,  
   memory_order Order1 = memory_order_seq_cst  
) volatile _NOEXCEPT;  
bool compare_exchange_strong(  
   Ty& Exp,  
   Ty Value,  
   memory_order Order1 = memory_order_seq_cst  
) _NOEXCEPT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Exp`  
 A value of type `Ty`.  
  
 `Value`  
 A value of type `Ty`.  
  
 `Order1`  
 First [memory_order](../vs140/memory_order-Enum.md) argument.  
  
 `Order2`  
 Second `memory_order` argument.  
  
## Return Value  
 A `bool` that indicates the result of the value comparison.  
  
## Remarks  
 This *atomic compare and exchange* operation compares the value that is stored in `*this` with `Exp`. If the values are equal, the operation replaces the value that is stored in `*this` with `Val` by using a `read-modify-write` operation and applying the memory order constraints that are specified by `Order1`. If the values are not equal, the operation uses the value that is stored in `*this` to replace `Exp` and applies the memory order constraints that are specified by `Order2`.  
  
 Overloads that do not have a second `memory_order` use an implicit `Order2` that is based on the value of `Order1`. If `Order1` is `memory_order_acq_rel`, `Order2` is `memory_order_acquire`. If `Order1` is `memory_order_release`, `Order2` is `memory_order_relaxed`. In all other cases, `Order2` is equal to `Order1`.  
  
 For overloads that take two `memory_order` parameters, the value of `Order2` must not be `memory_order_release` or `memory_order_acq_rel`, and must not be stronger than the value of `Order1`.
