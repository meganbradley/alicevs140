# Dependency &#39;dependency1&#39; of dependency &#39; dependency2&#39; is not an assembly
The project system has determined that a particular dependency (dependency1) of an assembly (dependency2) is not a .NET assembly.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Reinstall [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] (if the assembly came with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] or the .NET Framework).  
  
     \- or -  
  
-   Reinstall the appropriate third-party control.  
  
     This error will not prevent the project from building. However, a run-time error is possible.
