# Visual Studio SDK and Automation
You can write [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] applications by using automation, VSPackages, or a combination of the two. Automation add-ins can call [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] services, and [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] packages (VSPackages) can access the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] automation model. You can combine these two approaches to create an effective solution.  
  
 For an example of calling automation from a VSPackage, see [Walkthrough: Extending Managed VSPackages with Automation](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Extending%20Managed%20VSPackages%20By%20Using%20Automation.md). For an example of calling [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] services from an automation add-in, see [Walkthrough: Calling into the Visual Studio SDK from Automation](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Calling%20into%20the%20Visual%20Studio%20SDK%20By%20Using%20Automation.md).
