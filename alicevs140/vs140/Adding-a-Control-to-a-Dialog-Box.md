# Adding a Control to a Dialog Box
### To add a control to a dialog box  
  
1.  Ensure that the dialog box tabbed window is the current document in the editor frame. If a dialog is not the current document, you won't see the **Dialog Editor Tab** in the **Toolbox**.  
  
2.  On the [Dialog Editor Tab](../vs140/Dialog-Editor-Tab--Toolbox.md) of the [Toolbox Window](../vs140/Toolbox.md), select the control you want, then:  
  
    -   Click the dialog box at the location where you want to place the control. The control appears where you've clicked. For information, see [Adding Multiple Controls](../vs140/Adding-Multiple-Controls.md).  
  
         \- or -  
  
    -   Drag and drop the control from the Toolbox window to the location on your dialog box. For more information, see [Sizing a Control While You Add It](../vs140/Sizing-a-Control-While-You-Add-It.md).  
  
         \- or -  
  
    -   Double-click the control in the Toolbox window (it appears on your dialog box) then reposition the control to the location you prefer.  
  
 For information about the types of controls available on the Toolbox window, see [Dialog Editor Tab, Toolbox Window](../vs140/Dialog-Editor-Tab--Toolbox.md).
