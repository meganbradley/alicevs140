# Screens: The User Interface of Your LightSwitch Application
When you create an application in Visual Studio LightSwitch, you create screens to display data from databases, OData feeds, SharePoint lists, or Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Rich Internet Application (RIA) services  
  
 To create a screen, just specify the kind of screen you want and the data that you want to display on it and then let LightSwitch generate the screen for you. The generated screen will have the typical functionality of a modern user interface. You can tweak the appearance of the screen, enable or disable features, and add or remove commands.  
  
 In LightSwitch, you can create screens that are based on Silverlight or HTML. HTML screens are optimized for display on mobile devices.
