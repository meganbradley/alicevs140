# set_union
Unites all of the elements that belong to at least one of two sorted source ranges into a single, sorted destination range, where the ordering criterion may be specified by a binary predicate.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator>  
   OutputIterator set_union(  
      InputIterator1 _First1,   
      InputIterator1 _Last1,  
      InputIterator2 _First2,   
      InputIterator2 _Last2,   
      OutputIterator _Result  
   );  
template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator, class BinaryPredicate>  
   OutputIterator set_union(  
      InputIterator1 _First1,   
      InputIterator1 _Last1,  
      InputIterator2 _First2,   
      InputIterator2 _Last2,   
      OutputIterator _Result,  
      BinaryPredicate _Comp  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_First1`  
 An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in the first of two sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single range representing the union of the two source ranges.  
  
 `_Last1`  
 An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in the first of two sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single range representing the union of the two source ranges.  
  
 `_First2`  
 An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in second of two consecutive sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single range representing the union of the two source ranges.  
  
 `_Last2`  
 An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in second of two consecutive sorted source ranges to be united and sorted into a single range representing the union of the two source ranges.  
  
 **_** *Result*  
 An output iterator addressing the position of the first element in the destination range where the two source ranges are to be united into a single sorted range representing the union of the two source ranges.  
  
 `_Comp`  
 User-defined predicate function object that defines the sense in which one element is greater than another. The binary predicate takes two arguments and should return **true** when the first element is less than the second element and **false** otherwise.  
  
## Return Value  
 An output iterator addressing the position one past the last element in the sorted destination range representing the union of the two source ranges.  
  
## Remarks  
 The sorted source ranges referenced must be valid; all pointers must be dereferenceable and within each sequence the last position must be reachable from the first by incrementation.  
  
 The destination range should not overlap either of the source ranges and should be large enough to contain the destination range.  
  
 The sorted source ranges must each be arranged as a precondition to the application of the **merge** algorithm in accordance with the same ordering as is to be used by the algorithm to sort the combined ranges.  
  
 The operation is stable as the relative order of elements within each range is preserved in the destination range. The source ranges are not modified by the algorithm **merge**.  
  
 The value types of the input iterators need be less-than comparable to be ordered, so that, given two elements, it may be determined either that they are equivalent (in the sense that neither is less than the other) or that one is less than the other. This results in an ordering between the nonequivalent elements. When there are equivalent elements in both source ranges, the elements in the first range precede the elements from the second source range in the destination range. If the source ranges contain duplicates of an element, then the destination range will contain the maximum number of those elements that occur in both source ranges.  
  
 The complexity of the algorithm is linear with at most 2 \* ( (*_Last1 – _First1*) – (*_Last2 – _First2*) ) – 1 comparisons.

bool mod_lesser ( int elem1, int elem2 )  
{  
   if ( elem1 < 0 )   
      elem1 = - elem1;  
   if ( elem2 < 0 )   
      elem2 = - elem2;  
   return elem1 < elem2;
