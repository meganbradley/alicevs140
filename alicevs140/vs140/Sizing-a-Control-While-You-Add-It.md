# Sizing a Control While You Add It
### To size a control while you add it  
  
1.  Select a control in the [Toolbox Window](../vs140/Toolbox.md).  
  
2.  Place your cursor (which appears as cross hairs) where you want the upper-left corner of the new control to be on your dialog box.  
  
3.  Click and hold down the mouse button to anchor the upper-left corner of your control on the dialog box, then drag the cursor to the right and down until the control is the size you want.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can actually anchor any of the four corners of the control you're drawing. This procedure used the upper-left corner as an example.  
  
4.  Release the mouse button. The control settles onto the dialog box in the size you specified.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  You can resize the control after dropping it onto the dialog box by moving the sizing handles on the border of the control. For more information, see [Sizing Individual Controls](../vs140/Sizing-Individual-Controls.md).
