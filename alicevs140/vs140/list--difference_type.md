# list::difference_type
A signed integer type that can be used to represent the number of elements of a list in a range between elements pointed to by iterators.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef typename Allocator::difference_type difference_type;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `difference_type` is the type returned when subtracting or incrementing through iterators of the container. The `difference_type` is typically used to represent the number of elements in the range [`_First`, `_Last`) between the iterators `_First` and `_Last`, includes the element pointed to by `_First` and the range of elements up to, but not including, the element pointed to by `_Last`.  
  
 Note that although `difference_type` is available for all iterators that satisfy the requirements of an input iterator, which includes the class of bidirectional iterators supported by reversible containers like set, subtraction between iterators is only supported by random-access iterators provided by a random-access container, such as [vector Class](../vs140/vector-Class.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// list_diff_type.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <iostream>  
#include <list>  
#include <algorithm>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;  
  
   list <int> c1;  
   list <int>::iterator   c1_Iter, c2_Iter;  
  
   c1.push_back( 30 );  
   c1.push_back( 20 );  
   c1.push_back( 30 );  
   c1.push_back( 10 );  
   c1.push_back( 30 );  
   c1.push_back( 20 );  
  
   c1_Iter = c1.begin( );  
   c2_Iter = c1.end( );  
  
    list <int>::difference_type df_typ1, df_typ2, df_typ3;  
  
   df_typ1 = count( c1_Iter, c2_Iter, 10 );  
   df_typ2 = count( c1_Iter, c2_Iter, 20 );  
   df_typ3 = count( c1_Iter, c2_Iter, 30 );  
   cout << "The number '10' is in c1 collection " << df_typ1 << " times.\n";  
   cout << "The number '20' is in c1 collection " << df_typ2 << " times.\n";  
   cout << "The number '30' is in c1 collection " << df_typ3 << " times.\n";  
}  
```  
  
 **The number '10' is in c1 collection 1 times.**  
**The number '20' is in c1 collection 2 times.**  
**The number '30' is in c1 collection 3 times.**   
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <list\>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
