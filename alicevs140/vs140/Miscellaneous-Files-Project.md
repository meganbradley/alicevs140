# Miscellaneous Files Project
When a user opens project items, the IDE assigns to the Miscellaneous Files project any items that are not members of any projects in a solution.  
  
 Projects play a significant role in determining which editor is used when a user opens a project item. A project can be designed to open certain files by using a project-specific editor or a standard editor.  
  
 A project-specific editor typically requires that the user have special knowledge or use special interfaces from the project. For more information, see [How to: Open Project-Specific Editors](../vs140/How-to--Open-Project-Specific-Editors.md).  
  
 A standard editor can open any file of a specific extension in any project. The user can customize some standard editors, such as the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] text editor, for projects but still retain their public character. Standard editors are created by using the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsUIShellOpenDocument.OpenStandardEditor?qualifyHint=False> method.  
  
 If no project in the solution responds that it can open a project item, the IDE provides a special project called the Miscellaneous Files project that opens any file.  
  
 This special project provides for opening of a file outside the context of a project. During the processing of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsUIShellOpenDocument.OpenDocumentViaProject?qualifyHint=False> method, the Miscellaneous Files project always responds with a very low priority. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Files project always yields to any higher-priority project that can open files.  
  
 The Miscellaneous Files project does not require the user to explicitly create it with the **New Project** dialog box. Also, the Miscellaneous Files project does not permanently manage a list of project members. It uses an optional feature to record a list of most recently used files for each user.
