   ) const throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nLen`  
 The number of bytes in the file.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns `S_OK` on success, or an error `HRESULT` on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 Calls [GetFileSize](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa364955) to get the size in bytes of the file.  
  
##  <a name="catlfile__lockrange"></a>  CAtlFile::LockRange

### Remarks  
 Calls [LockFile](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365202) to lock a region in the file. Locking bytes in a file prevents access to those bytes by other processes. You can lock more than one region of a file, but no overlapping regions are allowed. When you unlock a region, using [CAtlFile::UnlockRange](../vs140/CAtlFile--UnlockRange.md), the byte range must correspond exactly to the region that was previously locked. `LockRange` does not merge adjacent regions; if two locked regions are adjacent, you must unlock each separately.
