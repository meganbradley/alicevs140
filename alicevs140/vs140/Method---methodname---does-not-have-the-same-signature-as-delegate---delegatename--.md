# Method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; does not have the same signature as delegate &#39;&lt;delegatename&gt;&#39;
There is a mismatch between the signatures of the method and delegate you are attempting to use. The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class. Any procedure with matching parameters, types, and return type may be used to create an instance of this delegate type. Each delegate class defines a constructor that is passed the specification of an object method.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30408  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check the signatures to find the mismatch, and correct it.
