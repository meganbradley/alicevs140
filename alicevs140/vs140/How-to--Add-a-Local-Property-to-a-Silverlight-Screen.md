# How to: Add a Local Property to a Silverlight Screen
You can add a field called a *local property* to a screen. You can use a local property to collect an input value or to display a calculated value.  
  
### To create a local property  
  
1.  From the top of the **Screen Designer**, click **Add Data Itemâ€¦**.  
  
     The **Add Data Item** dialog box appears.  
  
2.  In the **Add Data Item** dialog box, select **Local Property**.  
  
3.  In the **Type** drop-down list choose a type for the local property.  
  
     You can select any of the standard types, such as **String**, **Integer**, **Email Address**, or any of the entities that are associated with your application, such as **Customer**, **Order Detail**, or **Product**.  
  
4.  Select **Is Required** if you want to require this field to contain a value.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If this field does not contain a value when the user attempts to open the screen, a validation message appears.  
  
5.  In the **Name** textbox, type a name, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The **Add Data Item** dialog box will close. The local property appears in the **Screen Members List**.  
  
### To add a local property to a screen  
  
1.  From the **Screen Members List**, drag the local property onto the desired location of the **Screen Content Tree**.  
  
2.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, in the drop-down list that appears next to the local property, select the desired display type.  
  
     For example, if you are creating a local property to display a monetary value, you can change its display type to **Money Editor** or **Money Viewer**. Likewise, you can display a string local property as either a **Text Box** or a **Label**.  
  
### To apply validation rules to a local property  
  
1.  In the **Screen Members List**, select the local property.  
  
2.  From the **Properties** window, expand the **Validation** node if it is not already expanded.  
  
     The available validation rules will vary depending on the type of the local property.  
  
3.  If the local property must have a value, select **Is Required**.  
  
     Select any other validation rules that you want to apply to the local property.  
  
4.  If you need to perform more complex validation, click **Custom Validation**.  
  
     The Code Editor appears. [!INCLUDE[smb_current_short](../vs140/includes/smb_current_short_md.md)] generates a method named *localPropertyName*_Validate. You can add custom validation logic to this method. The following example displays an error message if the user enters less than three characters for a local property named `CityCode`.  
  
     [!CODE [LS_Screens#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Misc/ls_screens#1)]  
  
     If the string does not contain at least three characters, the property will be outlined in red and the error message you typed above appears.  
  
### To assign a value to a local property by using code  
  
1.  You can set a value to a local property by using code.  
  
     The following example sets the value of a local property named `ApprovedCheckBox` to `False`.  
  
     [!CODE [LS_Screens#2](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Misc/ls_screens#2)]
