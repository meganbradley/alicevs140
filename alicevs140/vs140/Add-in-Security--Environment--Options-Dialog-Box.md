# Add-in Security, Environment, Options Dialog Box
Use this page of the Options dialog box to define security settings for add-ins. You can access the Options dialog box by selecting Options from the Tools menu and then selecting the Add-in/Macros Security page in the Environment folder.  
  
 Administrators can prevent users from changing these settings. For more information about security for add-ins, see [Add-In Security](assetId:///44a5c651-6246-4310-b371-65378917c799).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must restart Visual Studio for any changes made to these options to take effect.  
  
## UIElement List  
 Allow Add-in components to load  
 When selected, add-ins are allowed to load and run automatically each time the IDE starts.  
  
 Allow Add-in components to load from a URL  
 When selected, remote add-ins can be loaded into [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] using a URL.  
  
 Add-in File Paths  
 A list of pre-defined common paths that allows you to specify the folders in which [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] uses to look for XML-based add-in definition files (.addin). For details about the various predefined paths, see [Add-In Security](assetId:///44a5c651-6246-4310-b371-65378917c799). For further details on how add-in definition files work, see [Add-In Registration](assetId:///d5c018ff-4dcb-4ff3-9dd4-0a66fa17d593).
