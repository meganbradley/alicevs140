# d3d_access_lock Function
Acquire a lock on an accelerator_view for the purpose of safely performing D3D operations on resources shared with the accelerator_view. The accelerator_view and all C++ AMP resources associated with this accelerator_view internally take this lock when performing operations and will block while another thread holds the D3D access lock. This lock is non-recursive: It is undefined behavior to call this function from a thread that already holds the lock. It is undefined behavior to perform operations on the accelerator_view or any data container associated with the accelerator_view from the thread that holds the D3D access lock. See also scoped_d3d_access_lock, a RAII-style class for a scope-based D3D access lock.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void __cdecl d3d_access_lock(  
   accelerator_view &_Av  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Av`  
 The accelerator_view to lock.
