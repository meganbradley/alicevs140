# Guide Settings Dialog Box
## Layout guides  
 Displays the settings for the layout guides.  
  
 **None**  
  
 Hides layout tools.  
  
 **Rulers and guides**  
  
 When enabled, adds rulers to the layout tools; guides can be placed in the rulers. The default guides are the margins, which can be moved by dragging. Click in the rulers to place a guide. Controls "snap" to guides when the controls are moved over or next to them. Controls also move with a guide once they are attached to it. When a control is attached to a guide on each side, and a guide is moved, the control is resized.  
  
 **Grid**  
  
 Creates a layout grid. New controls will automatically align to the grid.  
  
## Grid spacing  
 Displays the settings for the grid spacing in dialog box units (DLUs).  
  
 **Width: DLUs**  
  
 Sets the width of the layout grid in DLUs. A horizontal DLU is the average width of the dialog box font divided by four.  
  
 **Height: DLUs**  
  
 Sets the height of the layout grid in DLUs. A vertical DLU is the average height of the dialog box font divided by eight.
