# CRecordset::SetAbsolutePosition
Positions the recordset on the record corresponding to the specified record number.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void SetAbsolutePosition(   
   long nRows    
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nRows`  
 The one-based ordinal position for the current record in the recordset.  
  
## Remarks  
 `SetAbsolutePosition` moves the current record pointer based on this ordinal position.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is not valid on forward-only recordsets.  
  
 For ODBC recordsets, an absolute position setting of 1 refers to the first record in the recordset; a setting of 0 refers to the beginning-of-file (BOF) position.  
  
 You can also pass negative values to `SetAbsolutePosition`. In this case the recordset's position is evaluated from the end of the recordset. For example, `SetAbsolutePosition( -1 )` moves the current record pointer to the last record in the recordset.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Absolute position is not intended to be used as a surrogate record number. Bookmarks are still the recommended way of retaining and returning to a given position, since a record's position changes when preceding records are deleted. In addition, you cannot be assured that a given record will have the same absolute position if the recordset is re-created again because the order of individual records within a recordset is not guaranteed unless it is created with a SQL statement using an **ORDER BY** clause.  
  
 For more information about recordset navigation and bookmarks, see the articles [Recordset: Scrolling (ODBC)](../vs140/Recordset--Scrolling--ODBC-.md) and [Recordset: Bookmarks and Absolute Positions (ODBC)](../vs140/Recordset--Bookmarks-and-Absolute-Positions--ODBC-.md).  
  
## Exceptions  
 This method can throw exceptions of type **CDBException\*** and `CMemoryException*`.
