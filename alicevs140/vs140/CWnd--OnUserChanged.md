# CWnd::OnUserChanged
The framework calls this member for all windows after the user has logged on or off.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnUserChanged();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_USERCHANGED](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632651) notification message, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)]. When the user logs on or off, the operating system updates user-specific settings. The system sends this message immediately after updating the settings.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwin.h  
  
 This method is supported in [!INCLUDE[windowsver](../vs140/includes/windowsver_md.md)] and later.  
  
 Additional requirements for this method are described in [Build Requirements for Vista Common Controls](../vs140/Build-Requirements-for-Windows-Vista-Common-Controls.md).
