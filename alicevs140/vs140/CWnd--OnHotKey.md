# CWnd::OnHotKey
The framework calls this member function when the user presses a system-wide hot key.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnHotKey(  
    UINT nHotKeyId,   
    UINT nKey1,   
    UINT nKey2  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nHotKeyId`|Identifier for the hot key that generated the message. If the message was generated by a system-defined hot key, this parameter will be one of the following values:<br /><br /> -   `IDHOT_SNAPDESKTOP` - The snap desktop hot key was pressed.<br />-   `IDHOT_SNAPWINDOW` - The snap window hot key was pressed.|  
|[in] `nKey1`|A bitwise combination (OR) of flags that indicate the keys that were pressed in combination with the key specified by the `nKey2` parameter. The possible values are:<br /><br /> -   `MOD_ALT` - Either ALT key was held down.<br />-   `MOD_CONTROL` - Either CTRL key was held down.<br />-   `MOD_SHIFT` - Either SHIFT key was held down.<br />-   `MOD_WIN` - Either WINDOWS key was held down. These keys are labeled with the Microsoft Windows logo.|  
|[in] `nKey2`|The virtual key code of the hot key.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_HOTKEY](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646279) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)]. This message is placed at the top of the message queue associated with the thread that registered the hot key. Use the [RegisterHotKey](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646309) function to register a system-wide hot key.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
