# Unable to retrieve resource information
Scanning the hierarchy for .resx files failed.  
  
 As part of the `Preparing resources` build step, which is shown in the **Output** window, the project system scans the project hierarchy for all files with an .resx extension. This action will produce a list of .resx XML files that need to be transformed into binary .resources files before they can be included as resources in the project output.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Restart [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. If this does not work, call Microsoft Product Support Services to report the issue.  
  
     This error will cause a build to fail.
