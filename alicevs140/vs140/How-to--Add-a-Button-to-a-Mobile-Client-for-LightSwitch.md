# How to: Add a Button to a Mobile Client for LightSwitch
When you develop an HTML mobile client for your [!INCLUDE[smb_current_short](../vs140/includes/smb_current_short_md.md)] app, you can add code that runs when the user taps a button on a screen in that client. For example, you might add code that launches a different screen or performs a calculation.  
  
### To add a custom button to a screen  
  
1.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, choose the node where you want the button to appear.  
  
2.  On the **Screen Designer** toolbar, choose the **Add Layout Item** drop-down list, and then choose **Button**.  
  
     The **Add Button** dialog box appears.  
  
3.  ##### To use a built-in method  
4.  1.  In the **Add Button** dialog box, choose the **Choose an existing method** option button.  
  
    2.  In the **showDialog** list, choose the method to run.  
  
         If you choose a method that displays a screen or a dialog box, additional choices may appear. For more information, see [How to: Control Navigation between HTML Screens](../vs140/How-to--Control-Navigation-between-HTML-Screens-in-a-LightSwitch-App.md).  
  
    3.  Choose the **OK** button to create the button.  
5.  ##### To create your own method  
6.  1.  In the **Add Button** dialog box, choose the **Write my own method** option button.  
  
    2.  In the **Method** text box, enter a name for the button, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    3.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, open the shortcut menu for the new button node and choose **Edit Execute Code** code.  
  
         The code editor appears.  
  
    4.  In the code editor, add code that will run when the user taps the button.
