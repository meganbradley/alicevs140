# COleClientItem::Activate
Call this function to execute the specified verb instead of [DoVerb](../vs140/COleClientItem--DoVerb.md) so that you can do your own processing when an exception is thrown.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void Activate(  
   LONG nVerb,  
   CView* pView,  
   LPMSG lpMsg = NULL   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nVerb`  
 Specifies the verb to execute. It can be one of the following:  
  
|Value|Meaning|Symbol|  
|-----------|-------------|------------|  
|– 0|Primary verb|`OLEIVERB_PRIMARY`|  
|– 1|Secondary verb|(None)|  
|– 1|Display item for editing|`OLEIVERB_SHOW`|  
|– 2|Edit item in separate window|`OLEIVERB_OPEN`|  
|– 3|Hide item|`OLEIVERB_HIDE`|  
  
 The –1 value is typically an alias for another verb. If open editing is not supported, –2 has the same effect as –1. For additional values, see [IOleObject::DoVerb](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms694508) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)].  
  
 `pView`  
 Pointer to the container view window that contains the OLE item; this is used by the server application for in-place activation. This parameter should be **NULL** if the container does not support in-place activation.  
  
 `lpMsg`  
 Pointer to the message that caused the item to be activated.  
  
## Remarks  
 If the server application was written using the Microsoft Foundation Class Library, this function causes the [OnDoVerb](../vs140/COleServerItem--OnDoVerb.md) member function of the corresponding `COleServerItem` object to be executed.  
  
 If the primary verb is Edit and zero is specified in the `nVerb` parameter, the server application is launched to allow the OLE item to be edited. If the container application supports in-place activation, editing can be done in place. If the container does not support in-place activation (or if the Open verb is specified), the server is launched in a separate window and editing can be done there. Typically, when the user of the container application double-clicks the OLE item, the value for the primary verb in the `nVerb` parameter determines which action the user can take. However, if the server supports only one action, it takes that action, no matter which value is specified in the `nVerb` parameter.
