# Sizing Individual Controls
Use the sizing handles to resize a control. When the pointer is positioned on a sizing handle, it changes shape to indicate the directions in which the control can be resized. Active sizing handles are solid; if a sizing handle is hollow, the control cannot be resized along that axis.  
  
 You can also change the size of a control by snapping the control to guides or margins, or by moving one snapped control and guide away from another.  
  
### To size a control  
  
1.  Select the control.  
  
2.  Drag the sizing handles to change the size of the control:  
  
    -   Sizing handles at the top and sides change the horizontal or vertical size.  
  
    -   Sizing handles at the corners change both horizontal and vertical size.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  You can resize the control one dialog unit (DLU) at a time by holding down the SHIFT key and using the Right and Down ARROW keys.  
  
### To automatically size a control to fit the text within it  
  
1.  Choose **Size to Content** from the **Format** menu.  
  
 \- or -  
  
-   Right-click the control and choose **Size to Content** from the shortcut menu.
