# hash_map::reverse_iterator
> [!NOTE]
>  This API is obsolete. The alternative is [unordered_map Class](../vs140/unordered_map-Class.md).  
  
 A type that provides a bidirectional iterator that can read or modify an element in a reversed hash_map.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef list<typename Traits::value_type, typename Traits::allocator_type>::reverse_iterator reverse_iterator;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 A type `reverse_iterator` cannot modify the value of an element and is use to iterate through the hash_map in reverse.  
  
 The `reverse_iterator` defined by hash_map points to elements that are objects of [value_type](../vs140/hash_map--value_type.md), that is of type **pair<const Key, Type>**, whose first member is the key to the element and whose second member is the mapped datum held by the element.  
  
 To dereference a `reverse_iterator` `rIter` pointing to an element in a hash_map, use the -> operator.  
  
 To access the value of the key for the element, use `rIter` -> **first**, which is equivalent to (\*`rIter`).**first**. To access the value of the mapped datum for the element, use `rIter` -> **second**, which is equivalent to (\*`rIter`).**first**.  
  
 In Visual C++ .NET 2003, members of the [<hash_map>](../vs140/-hash_map-.md) and [<hash_set>](../vs140/-hash_set-.md) header files are no longer in the std namespace, but rather have been moved into the stdext namespace. See [The stdext Namespace](../vs140/stdext-Namespace.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
 See example for [rbegin](../vs140/hash_map--rbegin.md) for an example of how to declare and use `reverse_iterator`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <hash_map>  
  
 **Namespace:** stdext
