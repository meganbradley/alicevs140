# Cores View Zoom Tool
The Zoom control is a slider that lets you zoom in and out on the timeline so that you can focus on areas of particular interest. This control zooms on the center of the current view, so adjust the view before you zoom in.  
  
## Other Ways to Zoom  
  
-   Zooming in: Drag to select an area in the timeline view. When you release the mouse button, the timeline view zooms in on the selected range.  
  
-   Zooming in and out: Hover over the timeline and then press CTRL while you move the mouse wheel.
