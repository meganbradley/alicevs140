# CBitmap::CreateCompatibleBitmap
Initializes a bitmap that is compatible with the device specified by `pDC`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL CreateCompatibleBitmap(  
   CDC* pDC,  
   int nWidth,  
   int nHeight   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pDC`  
 Specifies the device context.  
  
 `nWidth`  
 Specifies the width (in pixels) of the bitmap.  
  
 `nHeight`  
 Specifies the height (in pixels) of the bitmap.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The bitmap has the same number of color planes or the same bits-per-pixel format as the specified device context. It can be selected as the current bitmap for any memory device that is compatible with the one specified by `pDC`.  
  
 If `pDC` is a memory device context, the bitmap returned has the same format as the currently selected bitmap in that device context. A "memory device context" is a block of memory that represents a display surface. It can be used to prepare images in memory before copying them to the actual display surface of the compatible device.  
  
 When a memory device context is created, GDI automatically selects a monochrome stock bitmap for it.  
  
 Since a color memory device context can have either color or monochrome bitmaps selected, the format of the bitmap returned by the `CreateCompatibleBitmap` function is not always the same; however, the format of a compatible bitmap for a nonmemory device context is always in the format of the device.  
  
 When you finish with the `CBitmap` object created with the `CreateCompatibleBitmap` function, first select the bitmap out of the device context, then delete the `CBitmap` object.
