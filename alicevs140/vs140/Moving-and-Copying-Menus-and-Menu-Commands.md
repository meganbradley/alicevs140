# Moving and Copying Menus and Menu Commands
You can move or copy menus and menu commands using the drag-and-drop method or by using commands on the shortcut menu (right-click menu).  
  
### To move or copy menus or menu commands using the drag-and-drop method  
  
1.  Drag or copy the item you want to move to:  
  
    -   A new location on the current menu.  
  
    -   A different menu. (You can navigate to other menus by dragging the mouse pointer over them.)  
  
2.  Drop the menu command when the insertion guide shows the position you want.  
  
### To move or copy menus or menu commands using shortcut menu commands  
  
1.  Right-click one or more menus or menu commands.  
  
2.  From the shortcut menu, choose **Cut** (to move) or **Copy**.  
  
3.  If you are moving the items to another menu resource or resource script file, [open it in another window](../vs140/Customizing-window-layouts-in-Visual-Studio.md).  
  
4.  Select the position of the menu or menu command you want to move or copy to.  
  
5.  From the shortcut menu, choose **Paste**. The moved or copied item is placed before the item you select.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can also drag, copy, and paste to other menus in other menu windows.
