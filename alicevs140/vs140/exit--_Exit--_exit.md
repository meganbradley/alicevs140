# exit, _Exit, _exit
Terminates the calling process. The `exit` function terminates it after cleanup; `_exit` and `_Exit` terminate it immediately.

## Syntax  
  
```  
void exit(   
   int const status   
);  
void _Exit(   
   int const status   
);  
void _exit(   
   int const status   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `status`  
 Exit status code.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `exit`, `_Exit` and `_exit` functions terminate the calling process. The `exit` function calls destructors for thread-local objects, then calls—in last-in-first-out (LIFO) order—the functions that are registered by `atexit` and `_onexit`, and then flushes all file buffers before it terminates the process. The `_Exit` and `_exit` functions terminate the process without destroying thread-local objects or processing `atexit` or `_onexit` functions, and without flushing stream buffers.  
  
 Although the `exit`, `_Exit` and `_exit` calls do not return a value, the low-order byte of `status` is made available to the host environment or waiting calling process, if one exists, after the process exits. Typically, the caller sets the `status` value to 0 to indicate a normal exit, or to some other value to indicate an error. The `status` value is available to the operating-system batch command `ERRORLEVEL` and is represented by one of two constants: `EXIT_SUCCESS`, which represents a value of 0, or `EXIT_FAILURE`, which represents a value of 1.  
  
 The `exit`, `_Exit`, `_exit`, `quick_exit`, `_cexit`, and `_c_exit` functions behave as follows.  
  
|Function|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|`exit`|Performs complete C library termination procedures, terminates the process, and provides the supplied status code to the host environment.|  
|`_Exit`|Performs minimal C library termination procedures, terminates the process, and provides the supplied status code to the host environment.|  
|`_exit`|Performs minimal C library termination procedures, terminates the process, and provides the supplied status code to the host environment.|  
|`quick_exit`|Performs quick C library termination procedures, terminates the process, and provides the supplied status code to the host environment.|  
|`_cexit`|Performs complete C library termination procedures and returns to the caller. Does not terminate the process.|  
|`_c_exit`|Performs minimal C library termination procedures and returns to the caller. Does not terminate the process.|  
  
 When you call the `exit`,  `_Exit` or `_exit` function, the destructors for any temporary or automatic objects that exist at the time of the call are not called. An automatic object is defined in a function where the object is not declared to be static. A temporary object is an object that's created by the compiler. To destroy an automatic object before you call `exit`, `_Exit`, or `_exit`, explicitly call the destructor for the object, as follows:  
  
```  
myObject.myClass::~myClass();  
```  
  
 Do not use `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` to call `exit` from `DllMain`. If you want to exit the `DLLMain` function, return `FALSE` from `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Function|Required header|  
|--------------|---------------------|  
|`exit`, `_Exit`, `_exit`|<process.h> or <stdlib.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../vs140/Compatibility.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_exit.c  
// This program returns an exit code of 1. The  
// error code could be tested in a batch file.  
  
#include <stdlib.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   exit( 1 );  
}  
```
