# &lt;PAVE_OVER&gt; How to: Configure Profiling Marks
Profiling marks are data points that can be inserted into a profiler data file during the performance session. Marks can be used to filter the data that is displayed in the Profiling Tools Report views. The profiling marks that are available in a performance session are shown in the **Marks** list of the **Data Collection Control** window. A list of default marks is created for every session. Profiling marks are listed in a row with a numeric identifier and a name.  
  
 You can modify the mark names, and add and remove marks in the **Data Collection Control** window. If the **Data Collection Control** window is not displayed, on the **Analyze** menu, point to **Windows**, and then click **Data Collection Control**.  
  
 For information about how to insert profiling marks in a profiler data file, see [How to: Insert Marks in a Profiler Data File](../vs140/-PAVE_OVER--How-to--Insert-Marks-in-a-Profiler-Data-File.md).
