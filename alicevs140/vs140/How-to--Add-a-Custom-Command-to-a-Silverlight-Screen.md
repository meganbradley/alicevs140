# How to: Add a Custom Command to a Silverlight Screen
You can add custom code that runs when the user clicks a button on a screen. First, add a custom command to a screen. Then, add custom code that runs when the user clicks the button.  
  
### To add a custom command to a screen  
  
1.  In the **Screen Content Tree** of the **Screen Designer**, decide where you want to place the command, and then perform one of the following actions:  
  
    -   Right-click the desired node, and then select **Add Button**.  
  
    -   Select the desired node. Then, on the command bar of the **Screen Designer**, click **Add Layout Item**, and then click **Button**.  
  
     The **Add Button** dialog box appears.  
  
2.  In the **Add Button** dialog box, select one of the following options:  
  
    -   Select **New Method** if you want to create a method that runs when the user clicks the button.  
  
    -   Select **Existing Method** if you want to use a method that has already been added to the screen. You must select the method from the **Name** drop-down list.  
  
3.  In the **Screen Content Tree**, right-click the command, and then click **Edit Execute Code**.  
  
     The Code Editor opens and generates a method named *ButtonName*_Execute.  
  
4.  Add custom code to the *ButtonName*_Execute method.
