# basic_string::find_last_not_of
Searches through a string for the last character that is not any element of a specified string.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_type find_last_not_of(  
    value_type _Ch,   
    size_type _Off = npos  
) const;  
size_type find_last_not_of(  
    const value_type* _Ptr,  
    size_type _Off = npos  
) const;  
size_type find_last_not_of(  
    const value_type* _Ptr,   
    size_type _Off,  
    size_type _Count  
) const;  
size_type find_last_not_of(  
    const basic_string<CharType, Traits, Allocator>& _Str,  
    size_type _Off = npos  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Ch`  
 The character value for which the member function is to search.  
  
 `_Off`  
 Index of the position at which the search is to finish.  
  
 `_Ptr`  
 The C-string for which the member function is to search.  
  
 `_Count`  
 The number of characters, counting forward from the first character, in the C-string for which the member function is to search.  
  
 `_Str`  
 The string for which the member function is to search.  
  
## Return Value  
 The index of the first character of the substring searched for when successful; otherwise `npos`.
