# IUMSUnblockNotification Structure
Represents a notification from the Resource Manager that a thread proxy which blocked and triggered a return to the scheduler's designated scheduling context has unblocked and is ready to be scheduled. This interface is invalid once the thread proxy's associated execution context, returned from the             `GetContext` method, is rescheduled.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
struct IUMSUnblockNotification;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[IUMSUnblockNotification::GetContext Method](#iumsunblocknotification__getcontext_method)|Returns the                                         `IExecutionContext` interface for the execution context associated with the thread proxy which has unblocked. Once this method returns and the underlying execution context has been rescheduled via a call to the                                         `IThreadProxy::SwitchTo` method, this interface is no longer valid.|  
|[IUMSUnblockNotification::GetNextUnblockNotification Method](#iumsunblocknotification__getnextunblocknotification_method)|Returns the next                                         `IUMSUnblockNotification` interface in the chain returned from the method                                         `IUMSCompletionList::GetUnblockNotifications`.|

##  <a name="iumsunblocknotification__getcontext_method"></a>  IUMSUnblockNotification::GetContext Method  
 Returns the                 `IExecutionContext` interface for the execution context associated with the thread proxy which has unblocked. Once this method returns and the underlying execution context has been rescheduled via a call to the                 `IThreadProxy::SwitchTo` method, this interface is no longer valid.  
  
```  
virtual IExecutionContext* GetContext() =0;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 An                         `IExecutionContext` interface for the execution context to a thread proxy which has unblocked.  
  
##  <a name="iumsunblocknotification__getnextunblocknotification_method"></a>  IUMSUnblockNotification::GetNextUnblockNotification Method  
 Returns the next                 `IUMSUnblockNotification` interface in the chain returned from the method                 `IUMSCompletionList::GetUnblockNotifications`.  
  
```  
virtual IUMSUnblockNotification* GetNextUnblockNotification() =0;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The next                         `IUMSUnblockNotification` interface in the chain returned from the method                         `IUMSCompletionList::GetUnblockNotifications`.
