# Compiler Error CS0025
Standard library file 'file' could not be found  
  
 A file that is needed by the compiler was not found. Check that the path is correct and that the file exists.  
  
 If the file is a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] system file, you may need to repair your [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] installation, or reinstall it completely.
