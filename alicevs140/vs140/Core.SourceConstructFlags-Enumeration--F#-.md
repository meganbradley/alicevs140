|-----------|-----------------|  
|None|Indicates that the compiled entity has no relationship to an element in F# source code.|  
|SumType|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# union type declaration.|  
|RecordType|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# record type declaration.|  
|ObjectType|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# class or other object type declaration.|  
|Field|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# record or union case declaration.|  
|Exception|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# exception declaration.|  
|Closure|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# closure.|  
|Module|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# module declaration.|  
|UnionCase|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of the representation of an F# union case declaration.|  
|Value|Indicates that the compiled entity is part of an F# value declaration.|  
|KindMask|The mask of values related to the kind of the compiled entity.|
