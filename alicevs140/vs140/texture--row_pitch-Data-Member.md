# texture::row_pitch Data Member
Gets the number of bytes between each row in a 2D or 3D staging texture on the CPU.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
__declspec(property(get=get_row_pitch)) unsigned int row_pitch;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This property contains the number of bytes between each row in a 2-dimensional staging texture, or between each row of a depth slice in 3-dimensional staging texture. Given the address of any element in the first row of the texture or depth slice, you can add `row_pitch` to calculate the address of the same element in the second row of the same texture or depth slice, and similarly for subsequent rows. The value of `row_pitch` compensates for the size of the texture elements as well as any additional padding that might exist between rows within the texture or depth slice. The value of `row_pitch` does not compensate for any additional padding between depth slices in a 3-dimensional texture, and canâ€™t be used to move between depth slices; to move between depth slices, use the [texture::depth_pitch Data Member](../vs140/texture--depth_pitch-Data-Member.md) instead.
