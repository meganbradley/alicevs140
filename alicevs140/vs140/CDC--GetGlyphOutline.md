# CDC::GetGlyphOutline
Retrieves the outline curve or bitmap for an outline character in the current font.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      DWORD GetGlyphOutline(  
   UINT nChar,  
   UINT nFormat,  
   LPGLYPHMETRICS lpgm,  
   DWORD cbBuffer,  
   LPVOID lpBuffer,  
   const MAT2* lpmat2  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nChar`  
 Specifies the character for which information is to be returned.  
  
 `nFormat`  
 Specifies the format in which the function is to return information. It can be one of the following values, or 0:  
  
|Value|Meaning|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|**GGO_BITMAP**|Returns the glyph bitmap. When the function returns, the buffer pointed to by `lpBuffer` contains a 1-bit-per-pixel bitmap whose rows start on doubleword boundaries.|  
|**GGO_NATIVE**|Returns the curve data points in the rasterizer's native format, using device units. When this value is specified, any transformation specified in `lpmat2` is ignored.|  
  
 When the value of `nFormat` is 0, the function fills in a [GLYPHMETRICS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd144955) structure but does not return glyph-outline data.  
  
 *lpgm*  
 Points to a **GLYPHMETRICS** structure that describes the placement of the glyph in the character cell.  
  
 `cbBuffer`  
 Specifies the size of the buffer into which the function copies information about the outline character. If this value is 0 and the `nFormat` parameter is either the **GGO_BITMAP** or **GGO_NATIVE** values, the function returns the required size of the buffer.  
  
 `lpBuffer`  
 Points to a buffer into which the function copies information about the outline character. If `nFormat` specifies the **GGO_NATIVE** value, the information is copied in the form of **TTPOLYGONHEADER** and **TTPOLYCURVE** structures. If this value is **NULL** and `nFormat` is either the **GGO_BITMAP** or **GGO_NATIVE** value, the function returns the required size of the buffer.  
  
 `lpmat2`  
 Points to a [MAT2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145048) structure that contains a transformation matrix for the character. This parameter cannot be **NULL**, even when the **GGO_NATIVE** value is specified for `nFormat`.  
  
## Return Value  
 The size, in bytes, of the buffer required for the retrieved information if `cbBuffer` is 0 or `lpBuffer` is **NULL**. Otherwise, it is a positive value if the function is successful, or –1 if there is an error.  
  
## Remarks  
 An application can rotate characters retrieved in bitmap format by specifying a 2-by-2 transformation matrix in the structure pointed to by `lpmat2`.  
  
 A glyph outline is returned as a series of contours. Each contour is defined by a [TTPOLYGONHEADER](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145158) structure followed by as many **TTPOLYCURVE** structures as are required to describe it. All points are returned as [POINTFX](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162806) structures and represent absolute positions, not relative moves. The starting point given by the **pfxStart** member of the [TTPOLYGONHEADER](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145158) structure is the point at which the outline for a contour begins. The [TTPOLYCURVE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145157) structures that follow can be either polyline records or spline records. Polyline records are a series of points; lines drawn between the points describe the outline of the character. Spline records represent the quadratic curves used by TrueType (that is, quadratic b-splines).
