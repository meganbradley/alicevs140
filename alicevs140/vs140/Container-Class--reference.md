# Container Class::reference
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the Standard C++ Library. For more information, see [STL Containers](../vs140/STL-Containers.md).  
  
 Describes an object that can serve as a reference to an element of the controlled sequence.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
typedef T2 reference;  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T2** (typically **Alloc::reference**). An object of type **reference** can be cast to an object of type [const_reference](../vs140/Container-Class--const_reference.md).
