# How to: Create Menu Items and Navigation Groups in LightSwitch
Menus and navigation groups in a LightSwitch client application that runs on a desktop appear on the **Navigation Menu** at run time. You manage menus and navigation groups on the **Screen Navigation** tab of the **DesktopClient Designer**.  
  
 Menu items are automatically added to the **Navigation Menu** for most screens that you create. Some screen types, such as the **Details Screen**, do not appear in the menu; they can be opened only by using a **Command** that calls the `Application.Show`*ScreenName* method. Menu items can be renamed. Renaming a menu item does not change the name or display name of the screen.  
  
 By default all menu items appear in a single **Tasks** group. You can rename the group, and you can create additional navigation groups and move menu items among them. You can also change the order of navigation groups. You can remove menu items that you do not want to display, and you can add a menu item to multiple navigation groups.  
  
 You can also specify the **Startup Screen** on the **Screen Navigation** tab. This is the screen that appears when the application starts; the menu item for the **Startup Screen** appears in bold text on the **Navigation Menu**.

1.  In **Solution Explorer**, choose the **Screens** node.
