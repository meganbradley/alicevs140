# C-C++ Preprocessor Reference
The *C/C++ Preprocessor Reference* explains the preprocessor as it is implemented in Microsoft C/C++. The preprocessor performs preliminary operations on C and C++ files before they are passed to the compiler. You can use the preprocessor to conditionally compile code, insert files, specify compile-time error messages, and apply machine-specific rules to sections of code.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Preprocessor Directives](../vs140/Preprocessor-Directives.md)  
 Describes directives, typically used to make source programs easy to change and easy to compile in different execution environments.  
  
 [Preprocessor Operators](../vs140/Preprocessor-Operators.md)  
 Discusses the four preprocessor-specific operators used in the context of the `#define` directive.  
  
 [Predefined Macros](../vs140/Predefined-Macros.md)  
 Discusses predefined macros as specified by ANSI and Microsoft C++.  
  
 [Pragmas](../vs140/Pragma-Directives-and-the-__Pragma-Keyword.md)  
 Discusses pragmas, which offer a way for each compiler to offer machine- and operating system-specific features while retaining overall compatibility with the C and C++ languages.
