# CAsyncSocket::Create
Call the **Create** member function after constructing a socket object to create the Windows socket and attach it.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL Create(  
   UINT nSocketPort = 0,  
   int nSocketType = SOCK_STREAM,  
   long lEvent = FD_READ | FD_WRITE | FD_OOB | FD_ACCEPT | FD_CONNECT | FD_CLOSE,  
   LPCTSTR lpszSocketAddress = NULL   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nSocketPort`  
 A well-known port to be used with the socket, or 0 if you want Windows Sockets to select a port.  
  
 `nSocketType`  
 **SOCK_STREAM** or **SOCK_DGRAM**.  
  
 `lEvent`  
 A bitmask which specifies a combination of network events in which the application is interested.  
  
-   **FD_READ** Want to receive notification of readiness for reading.  
  
-   **FD_WRITE** Want to receive notification of readiness for writing.  
  
-   **FD_OOB** Want to receive notification of the arrival of out-of-band data.  
  
-   **FD_ACCEPT** Want to receive notification of incoming connections.  
  
-   **FD_CONNECT** Want to receive notification of completed connection.  
  
-   **FD_CLOSE** Want to receive notification of socket closure.  
  
 *lpszSockAddress*  
 A pointer to a string containing the network address of the connected socket, a dotted number such as "128.56.22.8".Passing the **NULL** string for this parameter indicates the **CAsyncSocket** instance should listen for client activity on all network interfaces.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0, and a specific error code can be retrieved by calling [GetLastError](../vs140/CAsyncSocket--GetLastError.md). The following errors apply to this member function:  
  
-   **WSANOTINITIALISED** A successful [AfxSocketInit](../vs140/AfxSocketInit.md) must occur before using this API.  
  
-   **WSAENETDOWN** The Windows Sockets implementation detected that the network subsystem failed.  
  
-   **WSAEAFNOSUPPORT** The specified address family is not supported.  
  
-   **WSAEINPROGRESS** A blocking Windows Sockets operation is in progress.  
  
-   **WSAEMFILE** No more file descriptors are available.  
  
-   `WSAENOBUFS` No buffer space is available. The socket cannot be created.  
  
-   **WSAEPROTONOSUPPORT** The specified port is not supported.  
  
-   **WSAEPROTOTYPE** The specified port is the wrong type for this socket.  
  
-   **WSAESOCKTNOSUPPORT** The specified socket type is not supported in this address family.  
  
## Remarks  
 **Create** calls [Socket](../vs140/CASyncSocket--Socket.md) and if successful, it calls [Bind](../vs140/CAsyncSocket--Bind.md) to bind the socket to the specified address. The following socket types are supported:  
  
-   **SOCK_STREAM** Provides sequenced, reliable, full-duplex, connection-based byte streams. Uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for the Internet address family.  
  
-   **SOCK_DGRAM** Supports datagrams, which are connectionless, unreliable packets of a fixed (typically small) maximum length. Uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for the Internet address family.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The **Accept** member function takes a reference to a new, empty `CSocket` object as its parameter. You must construct this object before you call **Accept**. Keep in mind that if this socket object goes out of scope, the connection closes. Do not call **Create** for this new socket object.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  **Create** is **not** thread-safe.  If you are calling it in a multi-threaded environment where it could be invoked simultaneously by different threads, be sure to protect each call with a mutex or other synchronization lock.  
  
 For more information about stream and datagram sockets, see the articles [Windows Sockets: Background](../vs140/Windows-Sockets--Background.md) and [Windows Sockets: Ports and Socket Addresses](../vs140/Windows-Sockets--Ports-and-Socket-Addresses.md) and [Windows Sockets 2 API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms740673).
