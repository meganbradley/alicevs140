# CWnd::OnWinIniChange
The framework calls this member function after a change has been made to the Windows initialization file, WIN.INI.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnWinIniChange(  
   LPCTSTR lpszSection   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpszSection`  
 Points to a string that specifies the name of the section that has changed. (The string does not include the square brackets that enclose the section name.)  
  
## Remarks  
 The [SystemParametersInfo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724947) Windows function calls `OnWinIniChange` after an application uses the function to change a setting in the WIN.INI file.  
  
 To send the `WM_WININICHANGE` message to all top-level windows, an application can use the [SendMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644950) Windows function with its *hwnd* parameter set to **HWND_BROADCAST**.  
  
 If an application changes many different sections in WIN.INI at the same time, the application should send one `WM_WININICHANGE` message with `lpszSection` set to **NULL**. Otherwise, an application should send `WM_WININICHANGE` each time it makes a change to WIN.INI.  
  
 If an application receives an `OnWinIniChange` call with `lpszSection` set to **NULL**, the application should check all sections in WIN.INI that affect the application.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
