# Analyzing Performance Tools Data
The performance reports of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools enable you to view and analyze application performance problems. This section provides an overview of the performance reports and views that can be used to examine performance data.  
  
## Common Tasks  
  
|Task|Related Content|  
|----------|---------------------|  
|**Use performance rules to quickly identify issues:** Profiling Tools performance rules identify common issues and help you easily navigate to the source code that contains the issue. Detailed help topics can often suggest a solution.|-   [Using Performance Rules to Analyze Profiling Data](../vs140/Using-Performance-Rules-to-Analyze-Data.md)|  
|**Understand report view details:** Profiling Tools report views provide aggregated performance data for the processes, threads, modules, and functions of a profiling run. The data that appears depends on the profiling method that was used to collect the data.|-   [Profiling Tools Report Views](../vs140/Performance-Report-Views.md)|  
|**Configure, sort, and filter report views:** You can specify and order the data columns to display in a report, sort the report rows, and filter the data to include only a time segment that you specify.|-   [Customizing Report Views](../vs140/Customizing-Performance-Tools-Report-Views.md)|
