##  <a name="cpp2003"></a> Visual Studio 2003  
  
### Compiler  
  
-   Information on how to run a Managed Extensions for C++ application built with the current version's compiler on a previous version of the runtime; see Running a Managed Extensions for C++ Application on a Previous Version's Runtime.  
  
-   Managed Extensions for C++ Frequently Asked Questions.  
  
-   A walkthrough has been added showing how to port an existing, native application to use Managed Extensions for C++: Walkthrough: Porting an Existing Native C++ Application to Interoperate with .NET Framework Components  
  
-   You can now create a delegate on a method of a value type.  
  
-   The compiler's conformance with the C++ standard has been significantly enhanced for Visual C++ .NET 2003. See Standard Compliance Issues in Visual C++ for more information. See Breaking Changes in the Visual C++ Compiler for information on where your upgraded Visual C++ applications may no longer compile because of enhanced conformance.  
  
-   /arch compiler option is added.  
  
-   /Gf is deprecated and will be removed in the next version of Visual C++.  
  
-   /G7 compiler option is added.  
  
-   The /GS compiler option has been enhanced to help protect local variables from direct buffer overruns.  
  
-   The /noBool compiler option has been removed. The compiler now allows bool to appear only as a keyword (and not an identifier) in a C++ source code file.  
  
-   The long long type is now available as a typedef of __int64. See Fundamental Types for more information. Note that there is not yet support for long long in the CRT.  
  
-   The /Zm compiler option now specifies the precompiled header memory allocation limit.  
  
-   _InterlockedCompareExchange intrinsic now documented.  
  
-   _InterlockedDecrement intrinsic now documented.  
  
-   _InterlockedExchange intrinsic now documented.  
  
-   _InterlockedExchangeAdd intrinsic now documented.  
  
-   _InterlockedIncrement intrinsic now documented.  
  
-   _ReadWriteBarrier intrinsic added.  
  
### Attributes  
 implements attribute is now documented.  
  
### Linker features  
 The following linker switches have been added:  
  
-   /ASSEMBLYDEBUG  
  
-   /ASSEMBLYLINKRESOURCE  
  
-   DELAYSIGN  
  
-   /KEYFILE  
  
-   /KEYCONTAINER  
  
-   /SAFESEH  
  
### MASM

### New MASM Features  
  
-   MASM                                 expressions are now 64-bit values. In previous versions MASM expressions were                                 32-bit values.  
  
-   The instruction                                 __asm int 3 now causes a function to be compiled to native. For more                                 information, see [__asm](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/45yd4tzz\(v=vs.80\).aspx).

-   ml64.exe is a                                 version of MASM for the x64 architecture. It assembles x64 .asm files into x64                                 object files. Inline assembly language is not supported in the x64 compiler.                                 For more information, see [MASM for  
                                            x64 (ml64.exe)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hb5z4sxd\(v=vs.80\).aspx). The following MASM directives have been added for ml64.exe (x64):  
  
-   [.ALLOCSTACK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5btab6c7\(v=vs.80\).aspx)

-   [.SETFRAME](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2435h06y\(v=vs.80\).aspx) In addition, the [PROC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/01d2az3t\(v=vs.80\).aspx) directive was updated with x64-only syntax.  
  
-   [MMWORD](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3bt808ab\(v=vs.80\).aspx) directive has been added  
  
-   /omf                                 (ML.exe command line option) now implies /c. ML.exe does not support                                 linking OMF format objects.  
  
-   The [SEGMENT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d06y3478\(v=vs.80\).aspx) directive now supports additional attributes.

                                            SECTIONREL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177477\(v=vs.80\).aspx) has been added.  
  
-   [XMMWORD](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cw0399sf\(v=vs.80\).aspx) directive has been added  
  
### New CRT Features  
  
-   [Secure  
                                            versions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd3wzwts\(v=vs.80\).aspx) of several functions have been added. These functions handle                                 errors in a better way and enforce stricter controls on buffers to help avoid                                 common security flaws. The new secure versions are identified by the _s                                 suffix.  
  
-   Existing less secure versions of many functions have been                                 deprecated. To disable the deprecation warnings, define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS.                                 For more information, see [Security-Enhanced  
                                            Versions of CRT Functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd3wzwts\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   Many existing functions now validate their parameters and invoke                                 the invalid parameter handler when an invalid parameter is passed. For more                                 information, see the individual function references and the [Parameter  
                                            Validation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ksazx244\(v=vs.80\).aspx) topic.  
  
-   Many existing functions now set errno where they did not                                 before. See individual function references for specific errno                                 information.  
  
-   The typedef errno_t with type integer was added. errno_t                                 is used whenever a function return type or parameter deals with error codes                                 from errno. errno_t replaces errcode.  
  
-   Locale-dependent functions now have versions which take the                                 locale as a parameter rather than using the current locale. These new functions                                 have the _l suffix. Several new functions were added to work with locale                                 objects. New functions include [_get_current_locale](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3szh5e2z\(v=vs.80\).aspx),                                 [_create_locale](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4zx9aht2\(v=vs.80\).aspx) and [_free_locale](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/beadd31b\(v=vs.80\).aspx).                                 See individual function references for more information.  
  
-   New functions were added to support locking and unlocking file                                 handles. For more information, see [_lock_file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8w5bsb4f\(v=vs.80\).aspx) and [_unlock_file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s2z49acd\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   The _spawn family of functions does not reset errno                                 to zero on success, as it did in previous versions. For more information, see [_spawn,  
                                            _wspawn Functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/20y988d2\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   Versions of the printf family of functions that allow you                                 to specify the order in which the arguments are used are available. See [printf_p  
                                            Positional Parameters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bt7tawza\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_cprintf_p,  
                                            _cwprintf_p](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hy4t91t7\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_printf_p,  
                                            _wprintf_p](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s3a5ky4x\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_sprintf_p,  
                                            _swprintf_p](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/02y7cdtk\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_fprintf_p,  
                                            _fwprintf_p](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/35tfd78h\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_vprintf_p,  
                                            _vwprintf_p](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h72hc3e0\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_vsprintf_p,  
                                            _vswprintf_p](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c8c2ax31\(v=vs.80\).aspx), and [_vfprintf_p,  
                                            _vfwprintf_p](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/38hz5f36\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   Unicode is now a supported text format. The function _open                                 supports _O_TEXTW, _O_UTF8 and _O_UTF16 attributes. The                                 fopen function supports the "ccs=ENCODING" method of specifying a                                 Unicode format. For more information, see [_open,  
                                            _wopen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z0kc8e3z\(v=vs.80\).aspx) and [fopen,  
                                            _wfopen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yeby3zcb\(v=vs.80\).aspx) and [fopen_s,  
                                            _wfopen_s](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z5hh6ee9\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   A new version of the CRT libraries built in managed code (MSIL)                                 is now available and is used when compiling with the [/clr  
                                            (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k8d11d4s\(v=vs.80\).aspx) option. See [C  
                                            Run-Time Libraries](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/abx4dbyh\(v=vs.80\).aspx) for more information.  
  
-   [_fileinfo](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ecthkkx5\(v=vs.80\).aspx) has been removed.  
  
-   The default size for time_t is now 64 bits, which expands                                 the range of time_t and several of the time functions out to the year                                 3000. See [Time  
                                            Management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w4ddyt9h\(v=vs.80\).aspx), and the individual time functions.  
  
-   The CRT now supports setting the locale on a per thread basis.                                 The function [_configthreadlocale](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/26c0tb7x\(v=vs.80\).aspx) was added to support this feature.  
  
-   The [_statusfp2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9st43tcf\(v=vs.80\).aspx) and [__control87_2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e9b52ceh\(v=vs.80\).aspx) functions were added to allow access to and control of the floating point                                 control word on both the x87 and SSE2 floating point processor.  
  
-   The[_mkgmtime  
                                            and _mkgmtime64](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2093ets1\(v=vs.80\).aspx) functions were added to provide support for converting                                 times (struct tm) to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  
  
-   Changes were made to swprintf and [vswprintf](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/28d5ce15\(v=vs.80\).aspx) to better conform with the standard. For more information, see [sprintf,  
                                            _sprintf_l, swprintf, _swprintf_l, \__swprintf_l](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ybk95axf\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   A new header file, INTRIN.H, provides prototypes for some                                 intrinsic functions.  
  
-   The [fopen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yeby3zcb\(v=vs.80\).aspx) function now has an N attribute.  
  
-   The [_open](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z0kc8e3z\(v=vs.80\).aspx) function now has an _O_NOINHERIT attribute.  
  
-   The [atoi](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hc25t012\(v=vs.80\).aspx) function now returns INT_MAX and sets errno to ERANGE on                                 overflow. In previous versions, the overflow behavior was undefined.  
  
-   The [printf](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wc7014hz\(v=vs.80\).aspx) family of functions supports hexadecimal floating point output implemented                                 according to the ANSI C99 standard using the format type specifiers %a                                 and %A. For more information, see [printf  
                                            Type Field Characters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hf4y5e3w\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   The printf family now supports the "ll" (long                                 long) size prefix. For more information, see [Size and  
                                            Distance Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tcxf1dw6\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   The [_controlfp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e9b52ceh\(v=vs.80\).aspx) function has been optimized for better performance.  
  
-   Debug versions of some functions have been added. For more                                 information, see [_strdup_dbg,  
                                            _wcsdup_dbg](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3yf2858b\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_tempnam_dbg,  
                                            _wtempnam_dbg](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6yfsyebs\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_getcwd_dbg,  
                                            _wgetcwd_dbg](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6w0115c9\(v=vs.80\).aspx), [_getdcwd_dbg,  
                                            _wgetdcwd_dbg](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0d889d5x\(v=vs.80\).aspx),[_fullpath_dbg,  
                                            _wfullpath_dbg](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ce8baf8z\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   Added _chgsignl and _cpysignl (long double                                 versions).  
  
-   Added _locale_t type to type table.  
  
-   New macro [_countof  
                                            Macro](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175773\(v=vs.80\).aspx) added for computing number of elements in an array.  
  
-   In each function topic, a section on .NET Framework equivalents                                 has been added.  
  
-   Several string functions now have the option of truncating                                 strings rather than failing when output buffers are too small; see [_TRUNCATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175769\(v=vs.80\).aspx).  
  
-   [_set_se_translator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5z4bw5h5\(v=vs.80\).aspx) now requires the use of the [/EHa](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1deeycx5\(v=vs.80\).aspx) compiler option.  
  
-   fpos_t is now __int64 under /Za (for C code) and                                 when \__STDC\_\_ is set manually (for C++ code). It used to be a struct.  
  
-   [_CRT_DISABLE_PERFCRIT_LOCKS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235356\(v=vs.80\).aspx) can improve the I/O performance of single-threaded programs.  
  
-   POSIX names have been deprecated in favor of ISO C++ conformant                                 names (for example, use [_getch](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/078sfkak\(v=vs.80\).aspx) rather than [getch](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235446\(v=vs.80\).aspx)).  
  
-   New link options .obj files are available for pure mode. See [Link  
                                            Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235330\(v=vs.80\).aspx) for more details.  
  
-   [_recalloc](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235322\(v=vs.80\).aspx) combines features of [realloc](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xbebcx7d\(v=vs.80\).aspx) and [calloc](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3f8w183e\(v=vs.80\).aspx).
