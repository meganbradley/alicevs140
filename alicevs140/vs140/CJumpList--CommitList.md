# CJumpList::CommitList
Ends a list-building transaction and commits the reported list to the associated store (the registry in this case).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
BOOL CommitList();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
## Remarks  
 The commit is atomic. An error will be returned if the commit fails.  When `CommitList` is called, the current list of removed items will be cleaned up. Calling this method resets the object so that it does not have an active list-building transaction. To update the list, `BeginList` needs to be called again.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxadv.h
