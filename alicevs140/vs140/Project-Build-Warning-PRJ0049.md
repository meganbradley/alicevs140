# Project Build Warning PRJ0049
Referenced target '<Reference\>' requires .NET Framework <MinFrameworkVersion\> and will fail to run on this project's target framework  
  
 Applications created by using [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](../vs140/includes/vs_orcas_long_md.md)] can specify which version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] they should target. If you add a reference to an assembly or project that depends on a version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] that is later than the targeted version, you will get this warning at compile time.  
  
### To correct this warning  
  
1.  Choose one of the following:  
  
    -   Change the targeted framework in the project's **Property Pages** dialog box so that it is later than or equal to the minimal framework version of all referenced assemblies and projects. For more information, see [References, Common Properties, <Projectname\> Property Pages Dialog Box](../vs140/Adding-references-in-Visual-C---projects.md).  
  
    -   Remove the reference to the assembly or project that has a minimal framework version that is later than the targeted framework. These items will be marked with a warning icon in the project's **Property Pages**.
