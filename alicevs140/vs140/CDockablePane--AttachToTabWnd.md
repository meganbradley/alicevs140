# CDockablePane::AttachToTabWnd
Attaches the current pane to a target pane, creating a tabbed pane.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual CDockablePane* AttachToTabWnd(   
    CDockablePane* pTabControlBarAttachTo,  
    AFX_DOCK_METHOD dockMethod,  
    BOOL bSetActive = TRUE,  
    CDockablePane** ppTabbedControlBar = NULL  
);   
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [in] [out] `pTabControlBarAttachTo`  
 Specifies the target pane that the current pane attaches to. The target pane must be a dockable pane.  
  
 [in] `dockMethod`  
 Specifies the docking method.  
  
 [in] `bSetActive`  
 `TRUE` to activate the tabbed pane after the attach operation; otherwise, `FALSE`.  
  
 [out] `ppTabbedControlBar`  
 Contains the tabbed pane that results from the attach operation.  
  
## Return Value  
 A pointer to the current pane, if it is not a tabbed pane; otherwise a pointer to the tabbed pane that results from the attach operation. The return value is `NULL` if the current pane cannot be attached, or if an error occurs.  
  
## Remarks  
 When one dockable pane attaches to another pane using this method, the following occurs:  
  
1.  The framework checks whether the target pane `pTabControlBarAttachTo` is a regular docking pane or if it is derived from [CBaseTabbedPane](../vs140/CBaseTabbedPane-Class.md).  
  
2.  If the target pane is a tabbed pane, the framework adds the current pane to it as a tab.  
  
3.  If the target pane is a regular docking pane, the framework creates a tabbed pane.  
  
    -   The framework calls `pTabControlBarAttachTo->CreateTabbedPane`. The style of the new tabbed pane depends on the `m_pTabbedControlBarRTC` member. By default, this member is set to the runtime class of [CTabbedPane](../vs140/CTabbedPane-Class.md). If you pass the `AFX_CBRS_OUTLOOK_TABS` style as the `dwTabbedStyle` parameter to the [CDockablePane::Create](../vs140/CDockablePane--Create.md) method, the runtime class object is set to the runtime class of [CMFCOutlookBar](../vs140/CMFCOutlookBar-Class.md). You can change this member at any time to change the style of the new pane.  
  
    -   When this method creates a tabbed pane, the framework replaces the pointer to `pTabControlBarAttachTo` (if the pane is docked or floating in a multi-miniframe window) with a pointer to the new tabbed pane.  
  
    -   The framework adds the `pTabControlBarAttachTo` pane to the tabbed pane as the first tab. The framework then adds the current pane as a second tab.  
  
4.  If the current pane is derived from `CBaseTabbedPane`, all of its tabs are moved to `pTabControlBarAttachTo` and the current pane is destroyed. Therefore, be careful when you call this method, because a pointer to the current pane may be invalid when the method returns.  
  
 If you attach one pane to another when building a docking layout, set `dockMethod` to `DM_SHOW`.  
  
 You should dock the first pane before you attach another pane to it.
