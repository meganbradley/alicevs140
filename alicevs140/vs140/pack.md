# pack
Specifies packing alignment for structure, union, and class members.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
#pragma pack( [ show ] | [ push | pop ] [, identifier ] , n  )  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 To pack a class is to place its members directly after each other in memory, which can mean that some or all members can be aligned on a boundary smaller than the default alignment the target architecture. `pack` gives control at the data-declaration level. This differs from compiler option [/Zp](../Topic/-Zp%20\(Struct%20Member%20Alignment\).md), which only provides module-level control. `pack` takes effect at the first `struct`, `union`, or `class` declaration after the pragma is seen. `pack` has no effect on definitions. Calling `pack` with no arguments sets `n` to the value set in the compiler option **/Zp**. If the compiler option is not set, the default value is 8.  
  
 If you change the alignment of a structure, it may not use as much space in memory, but you may see a decrease in performance or even get a hardware-generated exception for unaligned access.  You can modify this exception behavior by using [SetErrorMode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms680621).  
  
 **show** (optional)  
 Displays the current byte value for packing alignment. The value is displayed by a warning message.  
  
 **push** (optional)  
 Pushes the current packing alignment value on the internal compiler stack, and sets the current packing alignment value to `n`. If `n` is not specified, the current packing alignment value is pushed.  
  
 **pop** (optional)  
 Removes the record from the top of the internal compiler stack. If `n` is not specified with **pop**, then the packing value associated with the resulting record on the top of the stack is the new packing alignment value. If `n` is specified, for example, `#pragma pack(pop, 16)`, `n` becomes the new packing alignment value. If you pop with `identifier`, for example, `#pragma pack(pop, r1)`, then all records on the stack are popped until the record that has `identifier` is found. That record is popped and the packing value associated with the resulting record on the top of is the stack the new packing alignment value. If you pop with an `identifier` that is not found in any record on the stack, then the **pop** is ignored.  
  
 `identifier` (optional)  
 When used with **push**, assigns a name to the record on the internal compiler stack. When used with **pop**, pops records off the internal stack until `identifier` is removed; if `identifier` is not found on the internal stack, nothing is popped.  
  
 `n` (optional)  
 Specifies the value, in bytes, to be used for packing. If the compiler option [/Zp](../Topic/-Zp%20\(Struct%20Member%20Alignment\).md) is not set for the module, the default value for `n` is 8. Valid values are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The alignment of a member will be on a boundary that is either a multiple of `n` or a multiple of the size of the member, whichever is smaller.  
  
 `#pragma pack(pop,` `identifier` `,`  `n` `)` is undefined.

    > [!WARNING]
    >  Note that in Visual Studio 2015 and later you can use the standard alignas and alignof operators which, unlike `__alignof` and `declspec( align )` are portable across compilers. The C++ standard does not address packing, so you must still use `pack` (or the corresponding extension on other compilers) to specify alignments smaller than the target architectureâ€™s word size.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample shows how to use the `pack` pragma to change the alignment of a structure.  
  
```  
// pragma_directives_pack.cpp  
#include <stddef.h>  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
struct S {  
   int i;   // size 4  
   short j;   // size 2  
   double k;   // size 8  
};  
  
#pragma pack(2)  
struct T {  
   int i;  
   short j;  
   double k;  
};  
  
int main() {  
   printf("%zu ", offsetof(S, i));  
   printf("%zu ", offsetof(S, j));  
   printf("%zu\n", offsetof(S, k));  
  
   printf("%zu ", offsetof(T, i));  
   printf("%zu ", offsetof(T, j));  
   printf("%zu\n", offsetof(T, k));  
}  
```  
  
```  
0 4 8  
0 4 6  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following sample shows how to use the **push**, **pop**, and **show** syntax.  
  
```  
// pragma_directives_pack_2.cpp  
// compile with: /W1 /c  
#pragma pack()   // n defaults to 8; equivalent to /Zp8  
#pragma pack(show)   // C4810  
#pragma pack(4)   // n = 4  
#pragma pack(show)   // C4810  
#pragma pack(push, r1, 16)   // n = 16, pushed to stack  
#pragma pack(show)   // C4810  
#pragma pack(pop, r1, 2)   // n = 2 , stack popped  
#pragma pack(show)   // C4810  
```
