# CWnd::OnActivateApp
The framework calls this member function to all top-level windows of the task being activated and for all top-level windows of the task being deactivated.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnActivateApp(  
   BOOL bActive,  
   DWORD dwThreadID  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bActive`  
 Specifies whether the `CWnd` is being activated or deactivated. **TRUE** means the `CWnd` is being activated. **FALSE** means the `CWnd` is being deactivated.  
  
 *dwThreadID*  
 Specifies the value of the thread ID. If `bActive` is **TRUE**, *dwThreadID* identifies the thread that owns the `CWnd` being deactivated. If `bActive` is **FALSE**, *dwThreadID* identifies the thread that owns the `CWnd` being activated.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
