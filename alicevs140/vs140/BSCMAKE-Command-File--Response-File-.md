# BSCMAKE Command File (Response File)
You can provide part or all of the command-line input in a command file. Specify the command file using the following syntax:  
  
```  
BSCMAKE @filename  
```  
  
 Only one command file is allowed. You can specify a path with *filename*. Precede *filename* with an at sign (@). BSCMAKE does not assume an extension. You can specify additional *sbrfiles* on the command line after *filename*. The command file is a text file that contains the input to BSCMAKE in the same order as you would specify it on the command line. Separate the command-line arguments with one or more spaces, tabs, or newline characters.  
  
 The following command calls BSCMAKE using a command file:  
  
```  
BSCMAKE @prog1.txt  
```  
  
 The following is a sample command file:  
  
```  
/n /v /o main.bsc /El  
/S (  
toolbox.h  
verdate.h c:\src\inc\screen.h  
)  
file1.sbr file2.sbr file3.sbr file4.sbr  
```
