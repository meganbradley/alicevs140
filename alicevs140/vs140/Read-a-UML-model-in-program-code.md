# Read a UML model in program code
You can load a UML model and its diagrams using the UML API.  
  
##  <a name="Reading"></a> Reading a Model in Program Code  
 To access the content of a model without showing it in a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] window, use `ModelingProject.LoadReadOnly()`.  
  
 For example:  
  
```  
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Uml.Classes;   
               // for IElement  
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.ArchitectureTools.Extensibility;   
               // for ModelingProject  
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.ArchitectureTools.Extensibility.Uml;  
               // for IModelStore  
...   
string projectPath = @"C:\MyProjectFolder\MyProject.modelproj";  
using (IModelingProjectReader projectReader =  
           ModelingProject.LoadReadOnly(projectPath))  
{  
   IModelStore store = projectReader.Store;  
   foreach (IClass umlClass in store.AllInstances<IClass>())  
   {   
       ...  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 If you want to read the shapes in a diagram, you must read the project and then the diagram.  
  
 For example:  
  
```  
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.ArchitectureTools.Extensibility.Presentation;   
                             // for IDiagram  
...  
foreach (string diagramFile in projectReader. DiagramFileNames)  
{   
  IDiagram diagram = projectReader.LoadDiagram(diagramFile);  
  foreach (IShape<IElement> shape   
         in diagram.GetChildShapes<IElement>())  
  { ... }  
}  
```  
  
## Alternative methods  
 For many applications, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Modelbus allows you to reference models and elements within them, with greater robustness and flexibility than with the methods described in this topic. It provides a standard method of making links between arbitrary elements, either in the same or different models. For more information, see [How to Link into UML Models using Visual Studio Model Bus](../vs140/Integrate-UML-models-with-other-models-and-tools.md).  
  
 You can also open models and diagrams in the user interface using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] API. For more information, see [How to Open a UML Model by using the Visual Studio API](../vs140/Open-a-UML-model-by-using-the-Visual-Studio-API.md).  
  
##  <a name="Standalone"></a> Stand-Alone Applications  
 The example in the previous section will work in Visual Studio extensions. It is possible to read a model in a stand-alone application, but you must add some references to your [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The details of how to read a model in a stand-alone application are likely to change in future versions of the product. Some features that are accessible in the current version might not be available in future versions.  
  
#### To add references to read a model in a stand-alone application.  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the project in which you are building the application, and then click **Properties**. In the properties editor, in the **Application** tab, set **Target Framework** to the required version of the .NET Framework.  
  
2.  Add the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_net](../vs140/includes/TLA2#tla_net_md.md)] references you need for accessing UML models, typically:  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.Uml.Interfaces.dll  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.ArchitectureTools.Extensibility.dll  
  
3.  In addition to the references listed in the previous sections, add the following project references from **\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio [version]\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies**:  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.Uml.dll  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamArchitect.ModelStore.Dsl.dll  
  
     If you want to read diagrams in your application, you might also require these references:  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamArchitect.ActivityDesigner.Dsl.dll  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamArchitect.ComponentDesigner.Dsl.dll  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamArchitect.LogicalClassDesigner.Dsl.dll  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamArchitect.SequenceDesigner.Dsl.dll  
  
    -   Microsoft.VisualStudio.TeamArchitect.UseCase.Dsl.dll
