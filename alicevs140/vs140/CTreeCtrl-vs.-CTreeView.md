# CTreeCtrl vs. CTreeView
MFC provides two classes that encapsulate tree controls: [CTreeCtrl](../vs140/CTreeCtrl-Class.md) and [CTreeView](../vs140/CTreeView-Class.md). Each class is useful in different situations.  
  
 Use `CTreeCtrl` when you need a plain child window control; for instance, in a dialog box. You'd especially want to use `CTreeCtrl` if there will be other child controls in the window, as in a typical dialog box.  
  
 Use `CTreeView` when you want the tree control to act like a view window in document/view architecture as well as a tree control. A `CTreeView` will occupy the entire client area of a frame window or splitter window. It will be automatically resized when its parent window is resized, and it can process command messages from menus, accelerator keys, and toolbars. Since a tree control contains the data necessary to display the tree, the corresponding document object does not have to be complicated â€” you could even use [CDocument](../vs140/CDocument-Class.md) as the document type in your document template.
