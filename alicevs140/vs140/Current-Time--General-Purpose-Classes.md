# Current Time: General Purpose Classes
The following procedure shows how to create a `CTime` object and initialize it with the current time.  
  
#### To get the current time  
  
1.  Allocate a `CTime` object, as follows:  
  
     [!CODE [NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#171](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#171)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Uninitialized `CTime` objects are not initialized to a valid time.  
  
2.  Call the `CTime::GetCurrentTime` function to get the current time from the operating system. This function returns a `CTime` object that can be used to set the value of `CTime`, as follows:  
  
     [!CODE [NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#172](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#172)]  
  
     Since `GetCurrentTime` is a static member function from the `CTime` class, you must qualify its name with the name of the class and the scope resolution operator (`::`), `CTime::GetCurrentTime()`.  
  
 Of course, the two steps outlined previously could be combined into a single program statement as follows:  
  
 [!CODE [NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#173](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#173)]
