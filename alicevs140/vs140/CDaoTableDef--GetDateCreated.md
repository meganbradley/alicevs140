# CDaoTableDef::GetDateCreated
Call this function to determine the date and time the table underlying the `CDaoTableDef` object was created.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
COleDateTime GetDateCreated( );  
  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 A value containing the date and time of the creation of the table underlying the `CDaoTableDef` object.  
  
## Remarks  
 The date and time settings are derived from the computer on which the base table was created or last updated. In a multiuser environment, users should get these settings directly from the file server to avoid discrepancies; that is, all clients should use a "standard" time source â€” perhaps from one server.  
  
 For related information, see the topic "DateCreated, LastUpdated Properties" in DAO Help.
