# Contextual Keywords (C# Reference)
A contextual keyword is used to provide a specific meaning in the code, but it is not a reserved word in C#. The following contextual keywords are introduced in this section:  
  
|Keyword|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[add](../vs140/add--C#-Reference-.md)|Defines a custom event accessor that is invoked when client code subscribes to the event.|  
|[async](../Topic/async%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Indicates that the modified method, lambda expression, or anonymous method is asynchronous.|  
|[await](../Topic/await%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Suspends an async method until an awaited task is completed.|  
|[dynamic](../vs140/dynamic--C#-Reference-.md)|Defines a reference type that enables operations in which it occurs to bypass compile-time type checking.|  
|[get](../vs140/get--C#-Reference-.md)|Defines an accessor method for a property or an indexer.|  
|[global](../vs140/global--C#-Reference-.md)|Specifies the default global namespace, which is otherwise unnamed.|  
|[partial](../vs140/partial--Type---C#-Reference-.md)|Defines partial classes, structs, and interfaces throughout the same compilation unit.|  
|[remove](../vs140/remove--C#-Reference-.md)|Defines a custom event accessor that is invoked when client code unsubscribes from the event.|  
|[set](../vs140/set--C#-Reference-.md)|Defines an accessor method for a property or an indexer.|  
|[value](../vs140/value--C#-Reference-.md)|Used to set accessors and to add or remove event handlers.|  
|[var](../vs140/var--C#-Reference-.md)|Enables the type of a variable declared at method scope to be determined by the compiler.|  
|[where](../Topic/where%20\(generic%20type%20constraint\)%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Adds constraints to a generic declaration. (See also [where](../Topic/where%20clause%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)).|  
|[yield](../Topic/yield%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Used in an iterator block to return a value to the enumerator object or to signal the end of iteration.|  
  
 All query keywords introduced in C# 3.0 are also contextual. For more information, see [Query Keywords (C# Reference)](../vs140/Query-Keywords--C#-Reference-.md).
