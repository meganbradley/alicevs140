# numeric (STL-CLR)
Defines container template functions that perform algorithms provided for numerical processing.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#include <cliext/numeric>  
```  
  
## Functions  
  
|Function|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|[accumulate (STL/CLR)](../vs140/accumulate--STL-CLR-.md)|Computes the sum of all the elements in a specified range including some initial value by computing successive partial sums or computes the result of successive partial results similarly obtained from using a specified binary operation other than the sum.|  
|[adjacent_difference (STL/CLR)](../vs140/adjacent_difference--STL-CLR-.md)|Computes the successive differences between each element and its predecessor in an input range and outputs the results to a destination range or computes the result of a generalized procedure where the difference operation is replaced by another, specified binary operation.|  
|[inner_product (STL/CLR)](../vs140/inner_product--STL-CLR-.md)|Computes the sum of the element-wise product of two ranges and adds it to a specified initial value or computes the result of a generalized procedure where the sum and product binary operations are replaced by other specified binary operations.|  
|[partial_sum (STL/CLR)](../vs140/partial_sum--STL-CLR-.md)|Computes a series of sums in an input range from the first element through the `i`th element and stores the result of each such sum in `i`th element of a destination range or computes the result of a generalized procedure where the sum operation is replaced by another specified binary operation.|
