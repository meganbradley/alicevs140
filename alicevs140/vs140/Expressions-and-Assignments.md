# Expressions and Assignments
This section describes how to form expressions and to assign values in the C language. Constants, identifiers, strings, and function calls are all operands that are manipulated in expressions. The C language has all the usual language operators. This section covers those operators as well as operators that are unique to C or Microsoft C. The topics discussed include:  
  
-   [L-value and r-value expressions](../vs140/L-Value-and-R-Value-Expressions.md)  
  
-   [Constant expressions](../vs140/C-Constant-Expressions.md)  
  
-   [Side effects](../vs140/Side-Effects.md)  
  
-   [Sequence points](../vs140/C-Sequence-Points.md)  
  
-   [Operators](../vs140/C-Operators.md)  
  
-   [Operator precedence](../vs140/Precedence-and-Order-of-Evaluation.md)  
  
-   [Type conversions](../vs140/Type-Conversions--C-.md)  
  
-   [Type casts](../vs140/Type-Cast-Conversions.md)
