# Modifiers (C# Reference)
Modifiers are used to modify declarations of types and type members. This section introduces the C# modifiers.  
  
|Modifier|Purpose|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|[Access Modifiers](../vs140/Access-Modifiers--C#-Reference-.md)<br /><br /> -   [public](../vs140/public--C#-Reference-.md)<br />-   [private](../vs140/private--C#-Reference-.md)<br />-   [internal](../vs140/internal--C#-Reference-.md)<br />-   [protected](../vs140/protected--C#-Reference-.md)|Specifies the declared accessibility of types and type members.|  
|[abstract](../vs140/abstract--C#-Reference-.md)|Indicates that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes.|  
|[async](../Topic/async%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Indicates that the modified method, lambda expression, or anonymous method is asynchronous.|  
|[const](../vs140/const--C#-Reference-.md)|Specifies that the value of the field or the local variable cannot be modified.|  
|[event](../Topic/event%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Declares an event.|  
|[extern](../Topic/extern%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Indicates that the method is implemented externally.|  
|[new](../vs140/new--C#-Reference-.md)|Explicitly hides a member inherited from a base class.|  
|[override](../vs140/override--C#-Reference-.md)|Provides a new implementation of a virtual member inherited from a base class.|  
|[partial](../vs140/partial--Type---C#-Reference-.md)|Defines partial classes, structs and methods throughout the same assembly.|  
|[readonly](../vs140/readonly--C#-Reference-.md)|Declares a field that can only be assigned values as part of the declaration or in a constructor in the same class.|  
|[sealed](../vs140/sealed--C#-Reference-.md)|Specifies that a class cannot be inherited.|  
|[static](../vs140/static--C#-Reference-.md)|Declares a member that belongs to the type itself instead of to a specific object.|  
|[unsafe](../vs140/unsafe--C#-Reference-.md)|Declares an unsafe context.|  
|[virtual](../vs140/virtual--C#-Reference-.md)|Declares a method or an accessor whose implementation can be changed by an overriding member in a derived class.|  
|[volatile](../Topic/volatile%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md)|Indicates that a field can be modified in the program by something such as the operating system, the hardware, or a concurrently executing thread.|
