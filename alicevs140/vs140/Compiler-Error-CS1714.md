# Compiler Error CS1714
The base class or interface of TypeName1 could not be resolved or is invalid  
  
 You are implementing TypeName1 from a class or interface that either could not be resolved, for example, the compiler was unable to locate it, or is invalid. The solution is to determine which of these two cases it is, and either more correctly specify the location of the type, or fix any compiler errors in the base class.
