# How to: Test for Equality (C++-CLI)
In the following sample, a test for equality that uses Managed Extensions for C++ is based on what the handles refer to.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// mcppv2_equality_test.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /LD  
using namespace System;  
  
bool Test1() {  
   String ^ str1 = "test";  
   String ^ str2 = "test";  
   return (str1 == str2);  
}  
```  
  
 The IL for this program shows that the return value is implemented by using a call to op_Equality.  
  
```  
IL_0012:  call       bool [mscorlib]System.String::op_Equality(string,  
                                                               string)  
```
