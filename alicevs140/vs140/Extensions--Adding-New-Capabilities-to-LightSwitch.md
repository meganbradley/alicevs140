# Extensions: Adding New Capabilities to LightSwitch
By using extensions, you can add new capabilities to [!INCLUDE[smb_current_long](../vs140/includes/smb_current_long_md.md)]. Custom extensions such as the Money and Phone Number business types are included in [!INCLUDE[smb_current_short](../vs140/includes/smb_current_short_md.md)]. Custom extensions such as the **Picture and Text** layout control provide new ways to present data on screen.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Extensions are only available in Silverlight client projects.  
  
 You can use shell extensions and theme extensions to change the appearance and behavior of your application by changing just one setting. When you apply a theme to a [!INCLUDE[smb_current_short](../vs140/includes/smb_current_short_md.md)] application, the visual appearance of screens and controls in the application is changed. A shell extension changes the layout of the application shell, for example, by displaying a toolbar or a ribbon in a different location.  
  
 Extensions are available from many sources, some at no cost and others for purchase. You can acquire some extensions directly by using **Extension Manager** in [!INCLUDE[smb_current_short](../vs140/includes/smb_current_short_md.md)]. After you use **Extension Manager** to download an extension, it appears on the **Extensions** tab of the **Application Designer**, and you can enable or disable it as required.
