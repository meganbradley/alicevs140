# Local variable &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39; is already declared in the current block
Two variables with the same name are declared in the same block (which can be a procedure or a control block such as `If...Then`).

### To correct this error  
  
-   Move one of the declarations to a different block, or change the name of one of the variables.
