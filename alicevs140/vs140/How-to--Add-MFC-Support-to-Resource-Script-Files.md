# How to: Add MFC Support to Resource Script Files
Normally, when you build an MFC application for Windows using the [MFC Application Wizard](../vs140/MFC-Application-Wizard.md), the wizard generates a basic set of files (including a resource script (.rc) file) that contains the core features of the Microsoft Foundation classes (MFC). However, if you are editing an .rc file for a Windows application that is not based on MFC, the following features specific to the MFC framework are not available:  
  
-   MFC code wizards (previously called "[MFC ClassWizard](assetId:///98dc2434-ba93-4e0b-b084-1a4bc26cdf1e)")  
  
-   Menu prompt strings  
  
-   List contents for combo box controls  
  
-   ActiveX control hosting  
  
 However, you can add MFC support to existing .rc files that do not have it.  
  
### To add MFC support to .rc files  
  
1.  Open the resource script file.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../vs140/How-to--Create-a-Resource-Script-File.md).  
  
2.  In [Resource View](../vs140/Resource-View-Window.md), highlight the resources folder (for example, MFC.rc).  
  
3.  In the [Properties window](../vs140/Properties-Window.md), set the **MFC Mode** property to **True**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In addition to setting this flag, the .rc file must be part of an MFC project. For example, just setting **MFC Mode** to **True** on an .rc file in a Win32 project won't give you any of the MFC features.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](assetId:///8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](assetId:///bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
