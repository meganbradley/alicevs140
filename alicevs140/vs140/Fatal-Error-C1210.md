# Fatal Error C1210
/clr:pure and /clr:safe are not supported by the version of the runtime installed  
  
 C1210 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.  
  
 Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.  
  
 To resolve C1210 install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.
