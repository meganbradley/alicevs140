# bitset::to_ulong
Converts a bitset object to the integer that would generate the sequence of bits contained if used to initialize the bitset.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
unsigned long to_ulong( ) const;  
  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 An integer that would generate the bits in a bitset if used in the initialization of the bitset.  
  
## Remarks  
 Applying the member function would return the integer that has the same sequence of 1 and 0 digits as is found in sequence of bits contained in the bitset.  
  
 The member function throws `overflow_error` if any bit in the bit sequence has a bit value that cannot be represented as a value of type `unsigned long`*.*  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// bitset_to_ulong.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <bitset>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
  
   bitset<5> b1 ( 7 );  
  
   cout << "The ordered set of bits in the bitset<5> b1( 7 )"  
        << "\n that was generated by the number 7 is: ( "  
        << b1 << " )" << endl;  
  
   unsigned long int i;  
   i = b1.to_ulong( );  
   cout << "The integer returned from the bitset b1,"  
        << "\n by the member function to_long( ), that"  
        << "\n generated the bits as a base two number is: "  
        << i << "." << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The ordered set of bits in the bitset<5> b1( 7 )**  
 **that was generated by the number 7 is: ( 00111 )**  
**The integer returned from the bitset b1,**  
 **by the member function to_long( ), that**  
 **generated the bits as a base two number is: 7.**
