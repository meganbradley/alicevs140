# hash_multimap::find
> [!NOTE]
>  This API is obsolete. The alternative is [unordered_multimap Class](../vs140/unordered_multimap-Class.md).  
  
 Returns an iterator addressing the first location of an element in a hash_multimap that has a key equivalent to a specified key.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      iterator find(  
   const Key& _Key  
);  
const_iterator find(  
   const Key& _Key  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Key`  
 The key to be matched by the sort key of an element from the hash_multimap being searched.  
  
## Return Value  
 An iterator that addresses the first location of an element with a specified key, or the location succeeding the last element in the hash_multimap if no match is found for the key.  
  
## Remarks  
 The member function returns an iterator that addresses an element in the hash_multimap whose sort key is **equivalent** to the argument key under a binary predicate that induces an ordering based on a less than comparability relation.  
  
 If the return value of **find** is assigned to a `const_iterator`, the hash_multimap object cannot be modified. If the return value of **find** is assigned to an **iterator**, the hash_multimap object can be modified.  
  
 In Visual C++ .NET 2003, members of the [<hash_map>](../vs140/-hash_map-.md) and [<hash_set>](../vs140/-hash_set-.md) header files are no longer in the std namespace, but rather have been moved into the stdext namespace. See [The stdext Namespace](../vs140/stdext-Namespace.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// hash_multimap_find.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <iostream>  
#include <hash_map>  
  
int main()  
{  
    using namespace std;  
    using namespace stdext;  
    hash_multimap<int, int> hm1;  
    hash_multimap<int, int> :: const_iterator hm1_AcIter, hm1_RcIter;  
    typedef pair<int, int> Int_Pair;  
  
    hm1.insert(Int_Pair(1, 10));  
    hm1.insert(Int_Pair(2, 20));  
    hm1.insert(Int_Pair(3, 20));  
    hm1.insert(Int_Pair(3, 30));  
  
    hm1_RcIter = hm1.find(2);  
    cout << "The element of hash_multimap hm1 with a key of 2 is: "  
          << hm1_RcIter -> second << "." << endl;  
  
    hm1_RcIter = hm1.find(3);  
    cout << "The first element of hash_multimap hm1 with a key of 3 is: "  
          << hm1_RcIter -> second << "." << endl;  
  
    // If no match is found for the key, end() is returned  
    hm1_RcIter = hm1.find(4);  
  
    if (hm1_RcIter == hm1.end())  
        cout << "The hash_multimap hm1 doesn't have an element "  
             << "with a key of 4." << endl;  
    else  
        cout << "The element of hash_multimap hm1 with a key of 4 is: "  
             << hm1_RcIter -> second << "." << endl;  
  
    // The element at a specific location in the hash_multimap can be  
    // found using a dereferenced iterator addressing the location  
    hm1_AcIter = hm1.end();  
    hm1_AcIter--;  
    hm1_RcIter = hm1.find(hm1_AcIter -> first);  
    cout << "The first element of hm1 with a key matching"  
         << endl << "that of the last element is: "  
         << hm1_RcIter -> second << "." << endl;  
  
    // Note that the first element with a key equal to  
    // the key of the last element is not the last element  
    if (hm1_RcIter == --hm1.end())  
        cout << "This is the last element of hash_multimap hm1."  
             << endl;  
    else  
        cout << "This is not the last element of hash_multimap hm1."  
             << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The element of hash_multimap hm1 with a key of 2 is: 20.**  
**The first element of hash_multimap hm1 with a key of 3 is: 20.**  
**The hash_multimap hm1 doesn't have an element with a key of 4.**  
**The first element of hm1 with a key matching**  
**that of the last element is: 20.**  
**This is not the last element of hash_multimap hm1.**
