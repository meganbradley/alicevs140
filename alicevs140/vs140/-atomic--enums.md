|[memory_order Enum](#memory_order_enum)|  
  
##  <a name="memory_order_enum"></a>  memory_order Enum  
 Supplies symbolic names for synchronization operations on memory locations. These operations affect how assignments in one thread become visible in another.  
  
```  
typedef enum memory_order {  
   memory_order_relaxed,  
   memory_order_consume,  
   memory_order_acquire,  
   memory_order_release,  
   memory_order_acq_rel,  
   memory_order_seq_cst,  
} memory_order;  
```  
  
### Remarks  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|`memory_order_relaxed`|No ordering required.|  
|`memory_order_consume`|A load operation acts as a consume operation on the memory location.|  
|`memory_order_acquire`|A load operation acts as an acquire operation on the memory location.|  
|`memory_order_release`|A store operation acts as a release operation on the memory location.|  
|`memory_order_acq_rel`|Combines `memory_order_acquire` and `memory_order_release`.|  
|`memory_order_seq_cst`|Combines `memory_order_acquire` and `memory_order_release`. Memory accesses that are marked as `memory_order_seq_cst` must be sequentially consistent.|
