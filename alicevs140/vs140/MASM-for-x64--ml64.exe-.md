# MASM for x64 (ml64.exe)
ml64.exe is the assembler that accepts [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../vs140/includes/vcprx64_md.md)] assembly language. For information on ml64.exe compiler options, see [ML and ML64 Command-Line Reference](../vs140/ML-and-ML64-Command-Line-Reference.md).  
  
 Inline ASM is not supported for [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../vs140/includes/vcprx64_md.md)]. Use MASM or compiler intrinsics ([x64 Intrinsics](assetId:///5d1f5d3e-156e-4ebf-932e-fd09be7ced62)).  
  
 The two workarounds are separate assembly with MASM (which supports x64 fully) and compiler intrinsics. We’ve added a lot of intrinsics to allow customers to make use of special-function instructions (e.g. privileged, bit scan/test, interlocked, etc…) in as close to cross-platform a manner as possible.  
  
## ml64-Specific Directives  
 Use the following directives with ml64.exe:  
  
-   [.ALLOCSTACK](../vs140/.ALLOCSTACK.md)  
  
-   [.ENDPROLOG](../vs140/.ENDPROLOG.md)  
  
-   [.PUSHFRAME](../vs140/.PUSHFRAME.md)  
  
-   [.PUSHREG](../vs140/.PUSHREG.md)  
  
-   [.SAVEREG](../vs140/.SAVEREG.md)  
  
-   [.SAVEXMM128](../vs140/.SAVEXMM128.md)  
  
-   [.SETFRAME](../vs140/.SETFRAME.md)  
  
 In addition, the [PROC](../vs140/PROC.md) directive was updated for use with ml64.exe.  
  
## 32-Bit Address Mode (Address Size Override)  
 MASM will emit the 0x67 address size override if a memory operand includes 32-bit registers. For example, the following examples cause the address size override to be emitted:  
  
```  
mov rax, QWORD PTR [ecx]  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx*2+r10d]  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx*2+r10d+0100h]  
prefetch [eax]  
movnti rax, QWORD PTR [r8d]  
```  
  
 MASM assumes that if a 32-bit displacement appears alone as a memory operand, 64-bit addressing is intended. There is currently no support for 32-bit addressing with such operands.  
  
 Finally, mixing register sizes within a memory operand, as demonstrated in the following code, will generate an error.  
  
```  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [rcx*2+r10d]  
mov eax, DWORD PTR [ecx*2+r10+0100h]  
```
