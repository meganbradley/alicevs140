# MSBuild Error MSB3142
**MSB3142: An error occurred trying to copy '<file\>' to '<folder\>': '<error\>'**  
  
 This error is generated when copying setup.bin to the build output directory. Possible causes for this error could be:  
  
-   You do not have permission to copy to the output directory.  
  
-   The disk is full.  
  
 These are the same potential reasons that file.copy or directory.createdirectory fail.
