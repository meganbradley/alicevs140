# locale::classic
The static member function returns a locale object that represents the classic C locale.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
static const locale& classic( );  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 A reference to the C locale.  
  
## Remarks  
 The classic C locale is the U.S. English ASCII locale within the Standard C Library that is implicitly used in programs that are not internationalized.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// locale_classic.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <iostream>  
#include <string>  
#include <locale>  
  
using namespace std;  
  
int main( )   
{  
   locale loc1( "german" );  
   locale loc2 = locale::global( loc1 );  
   cout << "The name of the previous locale is: " << loc2.name( )  
        << "." << endl;  
   cout << "The name of the current locale is: " << loc1.name( )   
        << "." << endl;  
  
   if (loc2 == locale::classic( ) )  
      cout << "The previous locale was classic." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The previous locale was not classic." << endl;  
  
   if (loc1 == locale::classic( ) )  
      cout << "The current locale is classic." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The current locale is not classic." << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The name of the previous locale is: C.**  
**The name of the current locale is: German_Germany.1252.**  
**The previous locale was classic.**  
**The current locale is not classic.**
