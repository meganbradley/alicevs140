# Managed VSPackages
The following topics explain how to create a VSPackage. A VSPackage is a software module that extends the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) by providing user interface (UI) elements, services, projects, editors, and designers. For more information, see [VSPackages](../vs140/VSPackages.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using Visual Studio Interop Assemblies](../Topic/Using%20Visual%20Studio%20Interop%20Assemblies.md)  
 Describes the function and location of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] interop assemblies and the namespaces they provide.  
  
 [HRESULT Information in Managed Code](../Topic/HRESULT%20Information%20in%20Managed%20Code.md)  
 Discusses how to translate HRESULT information into thrown exceptions and `int` return values in managed code.  
  
 [VSIP Interop Assembly Parameter Marshaling](../Topic/Visual%20Studio%20Interop%20Assembly%20Parameter%20Marshaling.md)  
 Discusses interoperability issues between the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] interop assemblies and COM interfaces.  
  
 [VSPackages and Managed Package Framework](../vs140/VSPackages-and-the-Managed-Package-Framework.md)  
 Describes and lists the managed package framework (MPF) class namespaces and DLL files and shows how to use them to create a VSPackage.  
  
 [Resources in Managed VSPackages](../Topic/Resources%20in%20VSPackages.md)  
 Describes the use of managed and unmanaged resources in managed VSPackages.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [VSPackage Architecture](../vs140/VSSDK-Utilities.md)  
 Presents a collection of VSPackage internals and advanced topics.
