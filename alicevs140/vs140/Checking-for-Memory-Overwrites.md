# Checking for Memory Overwrites
If you get an access violation on a call to a heap manipulation function, it is possible that your program has corrupted the heap. A common symptom of this situation would be:  
  
```  
Access Violation in _searchseg  
```  
  
 The [_heapchk](../vs140/_heapchk.md) function is available in both debug and release builds (Windows NT only) for verifying the integrity of the run time library heap. You can use `_heapchk` in much the same way as the `AfxCheckMemory` function to isolate a heap overwrite, for example:  
  
```  
if(_heapchk()!=_HEAPOK)  
   DebugBreak();  
```  
  
 If this function ever fails, you need to isolate at which point the heap was corrupted.
