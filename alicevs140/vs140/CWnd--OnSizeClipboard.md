# CWnd::OnSizeClipboard
The Clipboard owner's `OnSizeClipboard` member function is called by the Clipboard viewer when the Clipboard contains data with the `CF_OWNERDISPLAY` attribute and the size of the client area of the Clipboard-viewer window has changed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnSizeClipboard(  
   CWnd* pClipAppWnd,  
   HGLOBAL hRect   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pClipAppWnd`  
 Identifies the Clipboard-application window. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored.  
  
 *hRect*  
 Identifies a global memory object. The memory object contains a [RECT](../vs140/RECT-Structure.md) data structure that specifies the area for the Clipboard owner to paint.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `OnSizeClipboard` member function is called with a null rectangle (0,0,0,0) as the new size when the Clipboard application is about to be destroyed or minimized. This permits the Clipboard owner to free its display resources.  
  
 Within `OnSizeClipboard`, an application must use the [GlobalLock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366584) Windows function to lock the memory that contains the [RECT](../vs140/RECT-Structure.md) data structure. Have the application unlock that memory with the [GlobalUnlock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366595) Windows function before it yields or returns control.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
