# How to: Enable and Disable Edit and Continue
You can disable or enable Edit and Continue in the **Options** dialog box at design time. You cannot change this setting while you are debugging.  
  
 Edit and Continue works only in debug builds. For native C++, Edit and Continue requires using the /INCREMENTAL option.  
  
## Procedures  
  
#### To enable/disable Edit and Continue  
  
1.  Open debugging options page (**Tools / Options / Debugging**).  
  
2.  Scroll down to **Edit and Continue** category.  
  
3.  To enable, select the **Enable Edit and Continue** check box. To disable, clear the check box.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If IntelliTrace is enabled and you collect both IntelliTrace events and call information, Edit and Continue is disabled. For more information, see [Configure IntelliTrace](assetId:///7657ecab-e07e-4b1b-872d-f05d966be37e).  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
 For more information about these options, see [General, Debugging, Options Dialog Box](../vs140/General--Debugging--Options-Dialog-Box.md).
