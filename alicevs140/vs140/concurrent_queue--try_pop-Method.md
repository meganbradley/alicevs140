# concurrent_queue::try_pop Method
Dequeues an item from the queue if one is available. This method is concurrency-safe.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
bool try_pop(  
   _Ty& _Dest  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Dest`  
 A reference to a location to store the dequeued item.  
  
## Return Value  
 `true` if an item was successfully dequeued,`false` otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 If an item was successfully dequeued, the parameter `_Dest` receives the dequeued value, the original value held in the queue is destroyed, and this function returns `true`. If there was no item to dequeue, this function returns `false` without blocking, and the contents of the `_Dest` parameter are undefined.  
  
 `try_pop` is concurrency-safe with respect to calls to the methods `push`, `try_pop`, and `empty`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** concurrent_queue.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency
