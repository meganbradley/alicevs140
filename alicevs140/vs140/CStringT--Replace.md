# CStringT::Replace
There are two versions of `Replace`.The first version replaces one or more copies of a substring by using another substring. Both substrings are null-terminated. The second version replaces one or more copies of a character by using another character. Both versions operate on the character data stored in `CStringT`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int Replace(  
   PCXSTR pszOld,  
   PCXSTR pszNew  
);  
int Replace(  
   XCHAR chOld,  
   XCHAR chNew  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pszOld`  
 A pointer to a null-terminated string to be replaced by `pszNew`.  
  
 `pszNew`  
 A pointer to a null-terminated string that replaces `pszOld`.  
  
 `chOld`  
 The character to be replaced by `chNew`.  
  
 `chNew`  
 The character replacing `chOld`.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns the number of replaced instances of the character or substring, or zero if the string is not changed.  
  
## Remarks  
 `Replace` can change the string length because `pszNew` and `pszOld` do not have to be the same length, and several copies of the old substring can be changed to the new one. The function performs a case-sensitive match.  
  
 Examples of `CStringT` instances are `CString`, `CStringA`, and `CStringW`.  
  
 For `CStringA`, `Replace` works with ANSI or multibyte (MBCS) characters. For `CStringW`, `Replace` works with wide characters.  
  
 For `CString`, the character data type is selected at compile time, based on whether the constants in the following table are defined.  
  
|Defined Constant|Character Data Type|  
|----------------------|-------------------------|  
|`_UNICODE`|Wide characters|  
|`_MBCS`|Multi-byte characters|  
|Neither|Single-byte characters|  
|Both|Undefined|
