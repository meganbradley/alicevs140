# Compiler Error C3852
'member' having type 'type': aggregate initialization could not initialize this member  
  
 An attempt was made to assign a default initialization as part of an aggregate initialization to a data member that cannot receive a default initialization in an aggregate initialization.  
  
 The following samples generate C3852:  
  
```  
// C3852.cpp  
struct S  
{  
   short s;  
};  
  
struct S1  
{  
   int i;  
   const S s;  
};  
  
struct S2  
{  
   int i;  
   char & rc;  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
   S1 s1 = { 1 };   // C3852 const member   
   // try the following line instead  
   // S1 s1 = { 1, 2 };  
  
   S2 s2 = { 2 };   // C3852 reference member  
   // try the following line instead  
   // char c = 'a';  
   S2 s2 = { 2, c };  
}  
```
