# CInternetFile::Seek
Call this member function to reposition the pointer in a previously opened file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual ULONGLONG Seek(   
   LONGLONG lOffset,   
   UINT nFrom    
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lOffset`  
 Offset in bytes to move the read/write pointer in the file.  
  
 `nFrom`  
 Relative reference for the offset. Must be one of the following values:  
  
-   **CFile::begin** Move the file pointer `lOff` bytes forward from the beginning of the file.  
  
-   **CFile::current** Move the file pointer `lOff` bytes from the current position in the file.  
  
-   **CFile::end** Move the file pointer `lOff` bytes from the end of the file. `lOff` must be negative to seek into the existing file; positive values will seek past the end of the file.  
  
## Return Value  
 The new byte offset from the beginning of the file if the requested position is legal; otherwise, the value is undefined and a [CInternetException](../vs140/CInternetException-Class.md) object is thrown.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Seek` function permits random access to a file's contents by moving the pointer a specified amount, absolutely or relatively. No data is actually read during the seek.  
  
 At this time, a call to this member function is only supported for data associated with `CHttpFile` objects. It is not supported for FTP or gopher requests. If you call `Seek` for one of these unsupported services, it will pass back you to the Win32 error code **ERROR_INTERNET_INVALID_OPERATION**.  
  
 When a file is opened, the file pointer is at offset 0, the beginning of the file.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Using `Seek` may cause an implicit call to [Flush](../vs140/CInternetFile--Flush.md).  
  
## Exceptions  
 This method can throw exceptions of type `CInternetException*`.  
  
## Example  
 See the example for the base class implementation ([CFile::Seek](../vs140/CFile--Seek.md)).
