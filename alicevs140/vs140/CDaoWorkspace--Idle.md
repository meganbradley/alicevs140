# CDaoWorkspace::Idle
Call **Idle** to provide the database engine with the opportunity to perform background tasks that may not be up-to-date because of intense data processing.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      static void PASCAL Idle(   
   int nAction = dbFreeLocks    
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nAction`  
 An action to take during the idle processing. Currently the only valid action is **dbFreeLocks**.  
  
## Remarks  
 This is often true in multiuser, multitasking environments in which there is not enough background processing time to keep all records in a recordset current.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Calling **Idle** is not necessary with databases created with version 3.0 of the Microsoft Jet database engine. Use **Idle** only for databases created with earlier versions.  
  
 Usually, read locks are removed and data in local dynaset-type recordset objects is updated only when no other actions (including mouse movements) are occurring. If you periodically call **Idle**, you provide the database engine with time to catch up on background processing tasks by releasing unneeded read locks. Specifying the **dbFreeLocks** constant as an argument delays processing until all read locks are released.  
  
 This member function is not needed in single-user environments unless multiple instances of an application are running. The **Idle** member function may increase performance in a multiuser environment because it forces the database engine to flush data to disk, releasing locks on memory. You can also release read locks by making operations part of a transaction.
