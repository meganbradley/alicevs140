# rename (#import)
**C++ Specific**  
  
 Works around name collision problems.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
rename("OldName","NewName")  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `OldName`  
 Old name in the type library.  
  
 `NewName`  
 Name to be used instead of the old name.  
  
## Remarks  
 If this attribute is specified, the compiler replaces all occurrences of *OldName* in a type library with the user-supplied *NewName* in the resulting header files.  
  
 This attribute can be used when a name in the type library coincides with a macro definition in the system header files. If this situation is not resolved, then various syntax errors will be generated, such as [Compiler Error C2059](../vs140/Compiler-Error-C2059.md) and [Compiler Error C2061](../vs140/Compiler-Error-C2061.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The replacement is for a name used in the type library, not for a name used in the resulting header file.  
  
 For example, suppose a property named `MyParent` exists in a type library, and a macro `GetMyParent` is defined in a header file and used before `#import`. Since `GetMyParent` is the default name of a wrapper function for the error-handling **get** property, a name collision will occur. To work around the problem, use the following attribute in the `#import` statement:  
  
```  
rename("MyParent","MyParentX")  
```  
  
 which renames the name `MyParent` in the type library. An attempt to rename the `GetMyParent` wrapper name will fail:  
  
```  
rename("GetMyParent","GetMyParentX")  
```  
  
 This is because the name `GetMyParent` only occurs in the resulting type library header file.
