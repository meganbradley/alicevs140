# ISource::consume Method
When overridden in a derived class, consumes a message previously offered by this `ISource` block and successfully reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * consume(  
   runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> * _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the reserved `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `consume` method.  
  
## Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `consume` method is similar to `accept`, but must always be preceded by a call to `reserve` that returned `true`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency
