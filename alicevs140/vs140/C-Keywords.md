# C Keywords
"Keywords" are words that have special meaning to the C compiler. In translation phases 7 and 8, an identifier cannot have the same spelling and case as a C keyword. (See a description of [translation phases](../vs140/Phases-of-Translation.md) in the *Preprocessor Reference*; for information on identifiers, see [Identifiers](../vs140/C-Identifiers.md).) The C language uses the following keywords:  
  
|||||  
|-|-|-|-|  
|**auto**|**double**|`int`|`struct`|  
|**break**|**else**|**long**|`switch`|  
|**case**|`enum`|**register**|`typedef`|  
|`char`|`extern`|`return`|**union**|  
|**const**|**float**|**short**|`unsigned`|  
|**continue**|**for**|**signed**|`void`|  
|**default**|`goto`|`sizeof`|`volatile`|  
|**do**|**if**|**static**|`while`|  
  
 You cannot redefine keywords. However, you can specify text to be substituted for keywords before compilation by using C [preprocessor directives](../vs140/Preprocessor-Directives.md).  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The ANSI C standard allows identifiers with two leading underscores to be reserved for compiler implementations. Therefore, the Microsoft convention is to precede Microsoft-specific keyword names with double underscores. These words cannot be used as identifier names. For a description of the ANSI rules for naming identifiers, including the use of double underscores, see [Identifiers](../vs140/C-Identifiers.md).  
  
 The following keywords and special identifiers are recognized by the Microsoft C compiler:  
  
|||||  
|-|-|-|-|  
|`__asm`|**dllimport**2|`__int8`|`naked`2|  
|`__based`1|`__except`|`__int16`|`__stdcall`|  
|`__cdecl`|`__fastcall`|`__int32`|**thread**2|  
|`__declspec`|`__finally`|`__int64`|`__try`|  
|`dllexport`2|`__inline`|`__leave`||  
  
 1. The `__based` keyword has limited uses for 32-bit and 64-bit target compilations.  
  
 2. These are special identifiers when used with `__declspec`; their use in other contexts is not restricted.  
  
 Microsoft extensions are enabled by default. To ensure that your programs are fully portable, you can disable Microsoft extensions by specifying the /Za option (compile for ANSI compatibility) during compilation. When you do this, Microsoft-specific keywords are disabled.  
  
 When Microsoft extensions are enabled, you can use the keywords listed above in your programs. For ANSI compliance, most of these keywords are prefaced by a double underscore. The four exceptions, `dllexport`, **dllimport**, `naked`, and **thread**, are used only with `__declspec` and therefore do not require a leading double underscore. For backward compatibility, single-underscore versions of the rest of the keywords are supported.
