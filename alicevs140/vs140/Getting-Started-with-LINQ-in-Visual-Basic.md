 [Visual Basic 9.0 Features Supporting LINQ](../Topic/Visual%20Basic%20Features%20That%20Support%20LINQ.md)  
 Describes the Visual Basic language features that support LINQ, such as anonymous types and type inference.  
  
 [Type Relationships in Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../Topic/Type%20Relationships%20in%20Query%20Operations%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Describes how data types are preserved or transformed when queries are written and executed.
