# Implement Connection Point Wizard
This wizard implements a connection point for a COM object. A connectable object (that is, a source) can expose a connection point for its own interfaces or for any outgoing interface. Visual C++ and Windows both provide type libraries that have outgoing interfaces. Each outgoing interface can be implemented by a client on an object (that is, a sink).  
  
 For more information, see [ATL Connection Points](../vs140/ATL-Connection-Points.md).  
  
 **Available type libraries**  
 Displays the available type libraries containing the interface definitions for which you can implement connection points. Click the ellipsis button to locate a file containing the type library to use.  
  
 **Location**  
 Displays the location of the type library currently selected in the **Available type libraries** list.  
  
 **Interfaces**  
 Displays the interfaces whose definitions are contained in the type library currently selected in the **Available type libraries** box.  
  
|Transfer button|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|**>**|Adds to the **Implement connection points** list the interface name currently selected in the **Interfaces** list.|  
|**>>**|Adds to the **Implement connection points** list all interface names available in the **Interfaces** list.|  
|**<**|Removes the interface name currently selected in the **Implement connection points** list.|  
|**<<**|Removes all interface names currently listed in the **Implement connection points** list.|  
  
 **Implement connection points**  
 Displays the names of the interfaces for which you implement connection points when you click **Finish**.
