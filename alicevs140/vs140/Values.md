# Values
**ANSI 3.1.2.5** The representations and sets of values of the various types of floating-point numbers  
  
 The **float** type contains 32 bits: 1 for the sign, 8 for the exponent, and 23 for the mantissa. Its range is +/– 3.4E38 with at least 7 digits of precision.  
  
 The **double** type contains 64 bits: 1 for the sign, 11 for the exponent, and 52 for the mantissa. Its range is +/– 1.7E308 with at least 15 digits of precision.  
  
 The **long double** type contains 80 bits: 1 for the sign, 15 for the exponent, and 64 for the mantissa. Its range is +/– 1.2E4932 with at least 19 digits of precision. Note that with the Microsoft C compiler, the representation of type **long double** is identical to type **double**.
