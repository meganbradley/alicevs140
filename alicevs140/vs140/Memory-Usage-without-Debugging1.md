# Memory Usage without Debugging1
The **Memory Use** tool that was previously targeted at Windows 8.1 Store apps has been expanded to target more project types and platforms. Native memory diagnostics has also been enhanced. The tool can be run either with or without the debugger.  
  
 [Analyze memory use in the debugger](../vs140/Memory-Usage.md) describes the debugger-integrated tool.  
  
 [Run Visual Studio diagnostic tools without debugging](../vs140/Run-profiling-tools-without-debugging.md) describes how to attach the **Memory Use** tool to running apps or launch an installed app.
