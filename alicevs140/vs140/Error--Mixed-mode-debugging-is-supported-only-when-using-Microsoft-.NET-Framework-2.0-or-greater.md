# Error: Mixed mode debugging is supported only when using Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or greater
To debug mixed native and managed code, you must have [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] version 2.0, 3.0. 3.5, or 4.0. Mixed-mode debugging with earlier versions of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] is not supported.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Upgrade the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] to version 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0.
