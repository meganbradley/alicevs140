# .IF
Generates code that tests `condition1` (for example, AX > 7) and executes the *statements* if that condition is true.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
   .IF condition1   
statements  
[[.ELSEIF condition2   
   statements]]  
[[.ELSE  
   statements]]  
.ENDIF  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 If a [.ELSE](../vs140/.ELSE.md) follows, its statements are executed if the original condition was false. Note that the conditions are evaluated at run time.
