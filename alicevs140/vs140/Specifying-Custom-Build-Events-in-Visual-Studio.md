# Specifying Custom Build Events in Visual Studio
By specifying a custom build event, you can automatically run commands before a build starts or after it finishes. For example, you can run a .bat file before a build starts or copy new files to a folder after the build is complete. Build events run only if the build successfully reaches those points in the build process.  
  
 For specific information about the programming language that youâ€™re using, see the following topics:  
  
-   Visual Basic--[How to: Specify Build Events](../vs140/How-to--Specify-Build-Events--Visual-Basic-.md).  
  
-   Visual C# and F#--[How to: Specify Build Events (C#)](../vs140/How-to--Specify-Build-Events--C#-.md).  
  
-   Visual C++--[Specifying Build Events](../vs140/Specifying-Build-Events.md).  
  
## Syntax  
 Build events follow the same syntax as DOS commands, but you can use macros to create build events more easily. For a list of available macros, see [Pre-build Event/Post-build Event Command Line Dialog Box](../vs140/Pre-build-Event-Post-build-Event-Command-Line-Dialog-Box.md).  
  
 For best results, follow these formatting tips:  
  
-   Add a `call` statement before all build events that run .bat files.  
  
     Example: `call C:\MyFile.bat`  
  
     Example: `call C:\MyFile.bat call C:\MyFile2.bat`  
  
-   Enclose file paths in quotation marks.  
  
     Example (for [!INCLUDE[win8](../vs140/includes/win8_md.md)]): "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v8.0A\Bin\NETFX 4.0 Tools\gacutil.exe" -if "$(TargetPath)"  
  
-   Separate multiple commands by using line breaks.  
  
-   Include wildcards as needed.  
  
     Example: `for %I in (*.txt *.doc *.html) do copy %I c:\`*mydirectory*`\`  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  `%I` in the code above should be `%%I` in batch scripts.
