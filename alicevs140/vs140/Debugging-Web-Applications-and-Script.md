# Debugging Web Applications and Script
Table legend:  
  
 This section describes common debugging techniques for Web applications. For more information, see [Debugger Roadmap](../vs140/Debugger-Basics.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Debugging ASP.NET Web Applications](../vs140/Debugging-ASP.NET-and-AJAX-Applications.md)  
 Provides prerequisites and instructions for how to debug a [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../vs140/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application during development or after deployment.  
  
 [Debugging Web Applications: Errors and Troubleshooting](../vs140/Debugging-Web-Applications--Errors-and-Troubleshooting.md)  
 Lists errors that you might experience while you debug Web applications and suggests fixes.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Debugging a Parallel Application](../vs140/Walkthrough--Debugging-a-Parallel-Application.md)  
 Describes how to use the **Parallel Tasks** and **Parallel Stacks** tool windows to debug a parallel application.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Debugging Preparation: ASP.NET Web Applications](../vs140/Debugging-Preparation--ASP.NET-Web-Applications.md)  
 Describes the default project settings and behavior of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../vs140/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Web application projects, steps for debugging, and changing the default Debug configuration.  
  
 [Debugging in Visual Studio](../vs140/Debugging-in-Visual-Studio.md)  
 Provides links to the larger sections of the debugging documentation. Information includes the following: what's new in the debugger, settings and preparation, breakpoints, handling exceptions, edit and continue, debugging managed code, debugging [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../vs140/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] projects, debugging COM and ActiveX, debugging DLLs, debugging SQL, and the user interface references.  
  
 [Debugging Web Applications on a Remote Server](../vs140/Prerequistes-for-Remote-Debugging-Web-Applications.md)  
 Describes setup requirements for remote debugging of ASP.NET Web applications.  
  
 [Debug Code by Recording Execution History with IntelliTrace](../vs140/IntelliTrace.md)  
 Find bugs faster and easier by recording your app's execution history with IntelliTrace. Step backward and forward through recorded events and calls to examine your app's state at key points in time. Debug your code without setting lots of breakpoints or restarting your app as frequently. Requires Visual Studio Ultimate.
