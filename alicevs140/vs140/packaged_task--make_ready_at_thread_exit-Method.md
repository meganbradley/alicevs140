# packaged_task::make_ready_at_thread_exit Method
Calls the callable object that's stored in the *associated asynchronous state* and atomically stores the returned value.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
void make_ready_at_thread_exit(ArgTypes... args);  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 If the `packaged_task` object doesn't have an associated asynchronous state, this method throws a [future_error](../vs140/future_error-Class.md) that has an error code of `no_state`.  
  
 If this method or [make_ready_at_thread_exit](../vs140/packaged_task--make_ready_at_thread_exit-Method.md) has already been called for a `packaged_task` object that has the same associated asynchronous state, the method throws a `future_error` that has an error code of `promise_already_satisfied`.  
  
 Otherwise, this operator calls `INVOKE(fn, args..., Ty)`, where *fn* is the callable object that's stored in the associated asynchronous state. Any returned value is stored atomically as the returned result of the associated asynchronous state.  
  
 In contrast to [packaged_task::operator() Operator](../vs140/packaged_task--operator---Operator.md), the associated asynchronous state is not set to `ready` until after all thread-local objects in the calling thread have been destroyed. Typically, threads that are blocked on the associated asynchronous state are not unblocked until the calling thread exits.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** future  
  
 **Namespace:** std
