# Windows Runtime Unsupported CRT Functions
Many C run-time (CRT) APIs canâ€™t be used in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] apps that execute in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../vs140/includes/wrt_md.md)]. These apps are built by using the /ZW compiler flag. For a list of unsupported CRT functions, see [CRT functions not supported by /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  
  
 All CRT APIs are described in the [Alphabetical Function Reference](../vs140/CRT-Alphabetical-Function-Reference.md) section of the documentation.
