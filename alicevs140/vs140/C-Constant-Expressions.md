# C Constant Expressions
A constant expression is evaluated at compile time, not run time, and can be used in any place that a constant can be used. The constant expression must evaluate to a constant that is in the range of representable values for that type. The operands of a constant expression can be integer constants, character constants, floating-point constants, enumeration constants, type casts, `sizeof` expressions, and other constant expressions.  
  
## Syntax  
 *constant-expression*:  
 *conditional-expression*  
  
 *conditional-expression*:  
 *logical-OR-expression*  
  
 *logical-OR-expression* **?**  *expression* **:**  *conditional-expression*  
  
 *expression*:  
 *assignment-expression*  
  
 *expression* **,**  *assignment-expression*  
  
 *assignment-expression*:  
 *conditional-expression*  
  
 *unary-expression assignment-operator assignment-expression*  
  
 *assignment-operator*: one of  
 **= \*= /= %= += â€“= <<= >>= &= ^= &#124;=**  
  
 The nonterminals for struct declarator, enumerator, direct declarator, direct-abstract declarator, and labeled statement contain the *constant-expression* nonterminal.  
  
 An integral constant expression must be used to specify the size of a bit-field member of a structure, the value of an enumeration constant, the size of an array, or the value of a **case** constant.  
  
 Constant expressions used in preprocessor directives are subject to additional restrictions. Consequently, they are known as "restricted constant expressions." A restricted constant expression cannot contain `sizeof` expressions, enumeration constants, type casts to any type, or floating-type constants. It can, however, contain the special constant expression `defined (`*identifier*`)`.
