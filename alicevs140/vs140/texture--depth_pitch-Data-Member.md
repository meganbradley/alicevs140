# texture::depth_pitch Data Member
Gets the number of bytes between each depth slice in a 3D staging texture on the CPU.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
__declspec(property(get=get_depth_pitch)) unsigned int depth_pitch;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This property contains the number of bytes between each depth slice in a 3-dimensional staging texture. Given the address of any element in the first depth slice of the texture, you can add `depth_pitch` to calculate the address of the same element in the second depth slice of the same texture, and similarly for subsequent depth slices. The value of `depth_pitch` compensates for the size of the texture elements as well as any additional padding that might exist between depth slices and between rows within each depth slice.
