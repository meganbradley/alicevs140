# Visual Basic
Visual Basic is engineered for productively building type-safe and object-oriented applications. Visual Basic enables developers to target Windows, Web, and mobile devices. As with all languages targeting the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], programs written in Visual Basic benefit from security and language interoperability.  
  
 This generation of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] continues the tradition of giving you a fast and easy way to create [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)]-based applications.  
  
 If you don't already have Visual Basic, you can acquire a version of Visual Studio that includes Visual Basic for free from the [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/free-developer-offers-vs) site.
