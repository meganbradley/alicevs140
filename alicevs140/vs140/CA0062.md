# CA0062
The rule '*RuleId*' referenced in rule set '*RuleSetName*' could not be found.  
  
 This error indicates that the specified rule could not be found.  
  
 This error usually occurs because a ruleset file was edited by hand. To avoid this error, use the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] rule set editor to specify rules. For more information, see [Creating Custom Code Analysis Rule Sets](../vs140/Creating-Custom-Code-Analysis-Rule-Sets.md).  
  
 To resolve this issue, make sure that all the check ids that are specified in your ruleset file are valid. if you are using nonstandard rule files, make and that the appropriate rule hint paths are specified in your ruleset file.
