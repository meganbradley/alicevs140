# CRichEditCtrl::LineLength
Retrieves the length of a line in a rich edit control.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      int LineLength(  
   int nLine = -1   
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nLine`  
 Specifies the character index of a character in the line whose length is to be retrieved. If this parameter is â€“1, the length of the current line (the line that contains the caret) is returned, not including the length of any selected text within the line. When `LineLength` is called for a single-line edit control, this parameter is ignored.  
  
## Return Value  
 When `LineLength` is called for a multiple-line edit control, the return value is the length (in bytes) of the line specified by `nLine`. When `LineLength` is called for a single-line edit control, the return value is the length (in bytes) of the text in the edit control.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use the [LineIndex](../vs140/CRichEditCtrl--LineIndex.md) member function to retrieve a character index for a given line number within this `CRichEditCtrl` object.  
  
 For more information, see [EM_LINELENGTH](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761613) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)].  
  
## Example  
 See the example for [LineIndex](../vs140/CRichEditCtrl--LineIndex.md).
