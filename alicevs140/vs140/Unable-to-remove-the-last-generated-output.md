# Unable to remove the last generated output
The last known generated output was not removed from the disk and/or from the project.  
  
 If a custom tool returned a failure, the last generated output (if any) is removed from disk and from the project.  
  
 This might happen if the generated output is locked on disk.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Close and restart [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].
