# timed_mutex Class
Represents a *timed mutex type*. Objects of this type are used to enforce mutual exclusion through time-limited blocking within a program.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class timed_mutex;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[timed_mutex::timed_mutex Constructor](#timed_mutex__timed_mutex_constructor)|Constructs a `timed_mutex` object that's not locked.|  
|[timed_mutex::~timed_mutex Destructor](#timed_mutex___dtortimed_mutex_destructor)|Releases any resources that are used by the `timed_mutex` object.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[timed_mutex::lock Method](#timed_mutex__lock_method)|Blocks the calling thread until the thread obtains ownership of the `mutex`.|  
|[timed_mutex::try_lock Method](#timed_mutex__try_lock_method)|Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.|  
|[timed_mutex::try_lock_for Method](#timed_mutex__try_lock_for_method)|Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` for a specified time interval.|  
|[timed_mutex::try_lock_until Method](#timed_mutex__try_lock_until_method)|Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` until a specified time.|  
|[timed_mutex::unlock Method](#timed_mutex__unlock_method)|Releases ownership of the `mutex`.|  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** mutex  
  
 **Namespace:** std  
  
##  <a name="timed_mutex__lock_method"></a>  timed_mutex::lock Method  
 Blocks the calling thread until the thread obtains ownership of the `mutex`.  
  
```cpp  
void lock();  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the behavior is undefined.  
  
##  <a name="timed_mutex__timed_mutex_constructor"></a>  timed_mutex::timed_mutex Constructor  
 Constructs a `timed_mutex` object that is not locked.  
  
```cpp  
timed_mutex();  
```  
  
##  <a name="timed_mutex___dtortimed_mutex_destructor"></a>  timed_mutex::~timed_mutex Destructor  
 Releases any resources that are used by the `mutex` object.  
  
```cpp  
~timed_mutex();  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 If the object is locked when the destructor runs, the behavior is undefined.  
  
##  <a name="timed_mutex__try_lock_method"></a>  timed_mutex::try_lock Method  
 Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.  
  
```cpp  
bool try_lock();  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex`; otherwise, `false`.  
  
### Remarks  
 If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the behavior is undefined.  
  
##  <a name="timed_mutex__try_lock_for_method"></a>  timed_mutex::try_lock_for Method  
 Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.  
  
```cpp  
template<class Rep, class Period>  
   bool try_lock_for(const chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& Rel_time);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `Rel_time`  
 A [chrono::duration](../vs140/duration-Class.md) object that specifies the maximum amount of time that the method attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex`; otherwise, `false`.  
  
### Remarks  
 If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the behavior is undefined.  
  
##  <a name="timed_mutex__try_lock_until_method"></a>  timed_mutex::try_lock_until Method  
 Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.  
  
```cpp  
template<class Clock, class Duration>  
   bool try_lock_for(const chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>& Abs_time);  
bool try_lock_until(const xtime * Abs_time);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `Abs_time`  
 A point in time that specifies the threshold after which the method no longer attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex`; otherwise, `false`.  
  
### Remarks  
 If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the behavior is undefined.  
  
##  <a name="timed_mutex__unlock_method"></a>  timed_mutex::unlock Method  
 Releases ownership of the `mutex`.  
  
```cpp  
void unlock();  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 If the calling thread does not own the `mutex`, the behavior is undefined.
