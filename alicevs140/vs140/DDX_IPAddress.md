# DDX_IPAddress
The `DDX_IPAddress` function manages the transfer of data between an IP Address control and a data member of the control view object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void AFXAPI DDX_IPAddress(  
   CDataExchange* pDX,  
   int nIDC,  
   DWORD& value   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pDX`  
 A pointer to a `CDataExchange` object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  
  
 `nIDC`  
 The resource ID of the IP Address control associated with the control property.  
  
 *value*  
 A reference to the `DWORD` containing the four-field value of the IP Address control. The fields are filled or read as follows.  
  
|Field|Bits containing the field value|  
|-----------|-------------------------------------|  
|3|0 through 7|  
|2|8 through 15|  
|1|16 through 23|  
|0|24 through 31|  
  
 Use the Win32 [IPM_GETADDRESS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761378) to read the value, or use [IPM_SETADDRESS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761380) to fill the value. These messages are described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)].  
  
## Remarks  
 When `DDX_IPAddress` is called, *value* is either read from the IP Address control, or *value* is written to the control, depending on the direction of the exchange.
