# Lifetime, Scope, Visibility, and Linkage
To understand how a C program works, you must understand the rules that determine how variables and functions can be used in the program. Several concepts are crucial to understanding these rules:  
  
-   [Lifetime](../vs140/Lifetime.md)  
  
-   [Scope and visibility](../vs140/Scope-and-Visibility.md)  
  
-   [Linkage](../vs140/Linkage.md)
