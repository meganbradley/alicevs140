# Linker Tools Warning LNK4222
exported symbol 'symbol' should not be assigned an ordinal  
  
 The following symbols should not be exported by ordinal:  
  
-   `DllCanUnloadNow`  
  
-   `DllGetClassObject`  
  
-   `DllGetClassFactoryFromClassString`  
  
-   `DllInstall`  
  
-   `DllRegisterServer`  
  
-   `DllRegisterServerEx`  
  
-   `DllUnregisterServer`  
  
 These functions are always located by name, using `GetProcAddress`. The linker warns about this kind of export is because it could result in a larger image. This could happen if the range of your ordinal exports is large with relatively few exports. For example,  
  
```  
EXPORTS  
   DllGetClassObject   @1  
   MyOtherAPI      @100  
```  
  
 will require 100 slots in the export address table with 98 of them (2-99) just filler. On the other hand,  
  
```  
EXPORTS  
   DllGetClassObject  
   MyOtherAPI      @100  
```  
  
 will require two slots. (Be aware that you can also export with the [/EXPORT](../vs140/-EXPORT--Exports-a-Function-.md) linker option.)
