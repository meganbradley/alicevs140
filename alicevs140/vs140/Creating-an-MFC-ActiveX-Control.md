# Creating an MFC ActiveX Control
ActiveX control programs are modular programs designed to give a specific type of functionality to a parent application. For example, you can create a control such as a button for use in a dialog, or toolbar for use in a Web page.  
  
 The easiest way to create an MFC ActiveX control is to use the [MFC ActiveX Control Wizard](../vs140/MFC-ActiveX-Control-Wizard.md).  
  
### To create an MFC ActiveX Control using the MFC ActiveX Control Wizard  
  
1.  Follow the instructions in the help topic [Creating a Project with a Visual C++ Application Wizard](../vs140/Creating-Desktop-Projects-By-Using-Application-Wizards.md).  
  
2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, select the **MFC ActiveX Control** icon in the Templates pane to open the MFC ActiveX Control Wizard.  
  
3.  Define your [application settings](../vs140/Application-Settings--MFC-ActiveX-Control-Wizard.md), [control names](../vs140/Control-Names--MFC-ActiveX-Control-Wizard.md), and [control settings](../vs140/Control-Settings--MFC-ActiveX-Control-Wizard.md) using the MFC ActiveX Control Wizard.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Skip this step to keep the wizard default settings.  
  
4.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in the development environment.  
  
 After you have created your project, you can view the files created in **Solution Explorer**. For more information about the files the wizard creates for your project, see the project-generated file ReadMe.txt. For more information about the file types, see [File Types Created for Visual C++ Projects](../vs140/File-Types-Created-for-Visual-C---Projects.md).  
  
 After you have created your project, you can use the code wizards to add [functions](../vs140/Add-Member-Function-Wizard.md), [variables](../vs140/Add-Member-Variable-Wizard.md), [events](../vs140/Add-Event-Wizard.md), [properties](../vs140/Names--Add-Property-Wizard.md), and [methods](../vs140/Add-Method-Wizard.md). For more information about customizing your ActiveX control, see [MFC ActiveX Controls](../vs140/MFC-ActiveX-Controls.md).
