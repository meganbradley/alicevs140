# CAsyncSocket::SendTo
Call this member function to send data to a specific destination.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      int SendTo(  
   const void* lpBuf,  
   int nBufLen,  
   UINT nHostPort,  
   LPCTSTR lpszHostAddress = NULL,  
   int nFlags = 0   
);  
int SendTo(  
   const void* lpBuf,  
   int nBufLen,  
   const SOCKADDR* lpSockAddr,  
   int nSockAddrLen,  
   int nFlags = 0   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpBuf`  
 A buffer containing the data to be transmitted.  
  
 `nBufLen`  
 The length of the data in `lpBuf` in bytes.  
  
 `nHostPort`  
 The port identifying the socket application.  
  
 `lpszHostAddress`  
 The network address of the socket to which this object is connected: a machine name such as "ftp.microsoft.com," or a dotted number such as "128.56.22.8".  
  
 `nFlags`  
 Specifies the way in which the call is made. The semantics of this function are determined by the socket options and the `nFlags` parameter. The latter is constructed by combining any of the following values with the C++ `OR` operator:  
  
-   **MSG_DONTROUTE** Specifies that the data should not be subject to routing. A Windows Sockets supplier can choose to ignore this flag.  
  
-   **MSG_OOB** Send out-of-band data (**SOCK_STREAM** only).  
  
 `lpSockAddr`  
 A pointer to a [SOCKADDR](../vs140/SOCKADDR-Structure.md) structure that contains the address of the target socket.  
  
 `nSockAddrLen`  
 The length of the address in `lpSockAddr` in bytes.  
  
## Return Value  
 If no error occurs, `SendTo` returns the total number of characters sent. (Note that this can be less than the number indicated by `nBufLen`.) Otherwise, a value of **SOCKET_ERROR** is returned, and a specific error code can be retrieved by calling [GetLastError](../vs140/CAsyncSocket--GetLastError.md). The following errors apply to this member function:  
  
-   **WSANOTINITIALISED** A successful [AfxSocketInit](../vs140/AfxSocketInit.md) must occur before using this API.  
  
-   **WSAENETDOWN** The Windows Sockets implementation detected that the network subsystem failed.  
  
-   **WSAEACCES** The requested address is a broadcast address, but the appropriate flag was not set.  
  
-   **WSAEINPROGRESS** A blocking Windows Sockets operation is in progress.  
  
-   **WSAEFAULT** The `lpBuf` or `lpSockAddr` parameters are not part of the user address space, or the `lpSockAddr` argument is too small (less than the size of a [SOCKADDR](../vs140/SOCKADDR-Structure.md) structure).  
  
-   **WSAEINVAL** The host name is invalid.  
  
-   **WSAENETRESET** The connection must be reset because the Windows Sockets implementation dropped it.  
  
-   `WSAENOBUFS` The Windows Sockets implementation reports a buffer deadlock.  
  
-   **WSAENOTCONN** The socket is not connected (**SOCK_STREAM** only).  
  
-   **WSAENOTSOCK** The descriptor is not a socket.  
  
-   **WSAEOPNOTSUPP MSG_OOB** was specified, but the socket is not of type **SOCK_STREAM**.  
  
-   **WSAESHUTDOWN** The socket has been shut down; it is not possible to call `SendTo` on a socket after `ShutDown` has been invoked with `nHow` set to 1 or 2.  
  
-   **WSAEWOULDBLOCK** The socket is marked as nonblocking and the requested operation would block.  
  
-   **WSAEMSGSIZE** The socket is of type **SOCK_DGRAM**, and the datagram is larger than the maximum supported by the Windows Sockets implementation.  
  
-   **WSAECONNABORTED** The virtual circuit was aborted due to timeout or other failure.  
  
-   **WSAECONNRESET** The virtual circuit was reset by the remote side.  
  
-   **WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL** The specified address is not available from the local machine.  
  
-   **WSAEAFNOSUPPORT** Addresses in the specified family cannot be used with this socket.  
  
-   **WSAEDESTADDRREQ** A destination address is required.  
  
-   **WSAENETUNREACH** The network cannot be reached from this host at this time.  
  
## Remarks  
 `SendTo` is used on datagram or stream sockets and is used to write outgoing data on a socket. For datagram sockets, care must be taken not to exceed the maximum IP packet size of the underlying subnets, which is given by the **iMaxUdpDg** element in the [WSADATA](../vs140/WSADATA-Structure.md) structure filled out by [AfxSocketInit](../vs140/AfxSocketInit.md). If the data is too long to pass atomically through the underlying protocol, the error **WSAEMSGSIZE** is returned, and no data is transmitted.  
  
 Note that the successful completion of a `SendTo` does not indicate that the data was successfully delivered.  
  
 `SendTo` is only used on a **SOCK_DGRAM** socket to send a datagram to a specific socket identified by the `lpSockAddr` parameter.  
  
 To send a broadcast (on a **SOCK_DGRAM** only), the address in the `lpSockAddr` parameter should be constructed using the special IP address **INADDR_BROADCAST** (defined in the Windows Sockets header file WINSOCK.H) together with the intended port number. Or, if the `lpszHostAddress` parameter is **NULL**, the socket is configured for broadcast. It is generally inadvisable for a broadcast datagram to exceed the size at which fragmentation can occur, which implies that the data portion of the datagram (excluding headers) should not exceed 512 bytes.  
  
 To handle IPv6 addresses, use [CAsyncSocket::SendToEx](../vs140/CAsyncSocket--SendToEx.md).
