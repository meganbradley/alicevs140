# 2.4 Work-sharing Constructs
A work-sharing construct distributes the execution of the associated statement among the members of the team that encounter it. The work-sharing directives do not launch new threads, and there is no implied barrier on entry to a work-sharing construct.  
  
 The sequence of work-sharing constructs and **barrier** directives encountered must be the same for every thread in a team.  
  
 OpenMP defines the following work-sharing constructs, and these are described in the sections that follow:  
  
-   **for** directive  
  
-   **sections** directive  
  
-   **single** directive
