# CWnd::OnMouseHWheel
The framework calls this member when the current window is composed by the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), and that window is maximized.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnMouseHWheel(  
    UINT nFlags,   
    short zDelta,   
    CPoint pt  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nFlags`|A bitwise combination (OR) of flags that indicate which modifier keys are pressed. For example, the `MK_CONTROL` flag indicates that the CTRL key is pressed.<br /><br /> For a list of flags, see the "Message Parameters" subheading in [About Mouse Input](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645601).|  
|[in] `zDelta`|Indicates the distance the wheel is rotated, expressed in multiples or divisions of `WHEEL_DELTA`, which is 120. A positive value indicates that the wheel was rotated to the right; a negative value indicates that the wheel was rotated to the left.|  
|[in] `pt`|A [CPoint](../vs140/CPoint-Class.md) object that specifies the *x* and *y* coordinates of the cursor relative to the upper-left corner of the client area.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_MOUSEHWHEEL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645614) notification message, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)]. This message is sent to the window that has the focus when the mouse's horizontal scroll wheel is tilted or rotated.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwin.h  
  
 This method is supported in [!INCLUDE[windowsver](../vs140/includes/windowsver_md.md)] and later.
