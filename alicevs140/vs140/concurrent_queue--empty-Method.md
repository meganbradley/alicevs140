# concurrent_queue::empty Method
Tests if the concurrent queue is empty at the moment this method is called. This method is concurrency-safe.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
bool empty() const;  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 `true` if the concurrent queue was empty at the moment we looked, `false` otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 While this method is concurrency-safe with respect to calls to the methods `push`, `try_pop`, and `empty`, the value returned might be incorrect by the time it is inspected by the calling thread.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** concurrent_queue.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency
