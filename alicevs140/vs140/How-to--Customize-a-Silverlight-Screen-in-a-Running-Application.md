# How to: Customize a Silverlight Screen in a Running Application
You can modify the appearance of a screen while the application is running by using the **Customization Mode** screen. You can also see a preview of how the screen will look after you apply those changes. To open the **Customization Mode** screen, click the **Design Screen** button at the top of the screen.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **Design Screen** button appears at the top of a screen that is open in the running application only. This button does not appear above a screen that is open in the screen designer.  
  
 When you have finished making your changes, click the **Save** button to commit them.  
  
 ![link to video](../vs140/media/PlayVideo.gif "PlayVideo")For a related video demonstration, see [How Do I: Create an Edit Details Screen in a LightSwitch Application?](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=205123).  
  
 You can use the **Customization Mode** screen to accomplish the following design tasks:  
  
-   [Add a group of information to a screen](#add).  
  
-   [Modify the layout of a group](#modify).  
  
-   [Add buttons](#add2).  
  
-   [Remove items](#remove).  
  
-   [Move items](#move).  
  
-   [Change item captions](#change).  
  
-   [Change the label position of an item](#change3).  
  
-   [Show or hide an item](#specify).  
  
-   [Change the control type of an item (for example, a label or text box)](#change2).  
  
-   [Undo changes](#reverse).  
  
-   [Reset item properties to their default values](#reset).  
  
 For more information about how to accomplish design tasks by using the screen designer, see [How to: Customize a Screen by Using the Screen Designer](../Topic/How%20to:%20Design%20a%20Silverlight%20Screen%20by%20Using%20the%20Screen%20Designer.md).
