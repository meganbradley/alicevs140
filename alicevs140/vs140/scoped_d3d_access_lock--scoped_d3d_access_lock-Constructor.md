# scoped_d3d_access_lock::scoped_d3d_access_lock Constructor
Constructs a `scoped_d3d_access_lock` object. The lock is released when this object goes out of scope.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
explicit scoped_d3d_access_lock(        // [1] constructor  
   accelerator_view &_Av  
);  
  
explicit scoped_d3d_access_lock(        // [2] constructor  
   accelerator_view &_Av,  
   adopt_d3d_access_lock_t _T  
);  
  
scoped_d3d_access_lock(                 // [3] move constructor  
   scoped_d3d_access_lock &&_Other  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Av`  
 The `accelerator_view` for the lock to adopt.  
  
 `_T`  
 The `adopt_d3d_access_lock_t` object.  
  
 `_Other`  
 The `scoped_d3d_access_lock` object from which to move an existing lock.  
  
## Construction  
 [1] Constructor  
 Acquires a D3D access lock on the given [accelerator_view](../vs140/accelerator_view-Class.md) object. Construction blocks until the lock is acquired.  
  
 [2] Constructor  
 Adopt a D3D access lock from the given [accelerator_view](../vs140/accelerator_view-Class.md) object.  
  
 [3] Move Constructor  
 Takes an existing D3D access lock from another `scoped_d3d_access_lock` object. Construction does not block.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** amprt.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency::direct3d
