# Version Compatibility for Code Analysis Check-In Policies
If you must evaluate and author code analysis check-in policies using different versions of [!INCLUDE[esprtfc](../vs140/includes/esprtfc_md.md)], you must know the differences in how [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasLong](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasLong_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] evaluate check-in policies.  
  
## Version Compatibility for Evaluating Check-In Policies  
  
-   When code analysis check-in policies are evaluated in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)], any rules that existed in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] but do not exist in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)] are ignored.  
  
-   When code analysis check-in policies are evaluated in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)], all new rules that are exclusive to [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)] are ignored.  
  
-   If the code analysis check-in policy specifies rules assemblies, [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)] ignores all rules that are specified by assemblies that it does not recognize.  
  
-   If the code analysis check-in policy specifies rules assemblies that [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] does not recognize, a message is displayed.  
  
## Version Compatibility for Authoring Check-In Policies  
  
-   If you created a code analysis check-in policy by using the [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)] version of [!INCLUDE[esprtfc](../vs140/includes/esprtfc_md.md)], you cannot use the [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] version of [!INCLUDE[esprtfc](../vs140/includes/esprtfc_md.md)] to modify it. And also, [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] cannot evaluate the policy.  
  
-   If you created a code analysis check-in policy by using [!INCLUDE[esprtfc](../vs140/includes/esprtfc_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)], you can use [!INCLUDE[esprtfc](../vs140/includes/esprtfc_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)] to modify it, and the policy can also be evaluated by [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)]. After you modify the policy by using [!INCLUDE[esprtfc](../vs140/includes/esprtfc_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)], you can no longer edit the policy by using [!INCLUDE[esprtfc](../vs140/includes/esprtfc_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] can evaluate the policies without problems with mismatched strong names.  
  
-   To create a code analysis check-in policy with rule settings that apply for both [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)], you must create the policy in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)], make all the changes needed, and save the policy. If the changes to rules exist only in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)], you modify and save the policy in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)].  
  
     After you save the policy in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsOrcasShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsOrcasShort_md.md)], you can no longer change settings for rules that exist in [!INCLUDE[vstsTfsRosarioShort](../vs140/includes/vstsTfsRosarioShort_md.md)] only.
