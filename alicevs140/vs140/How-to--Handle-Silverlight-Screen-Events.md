# How to: Handle Silverlight Screen Events
You can customize your application by writing code that runs when certain events happen. For example, you can write code that runs before data is saved to a data source.  
  
 The events you can handle can be grouped into four categories:  
  
-   Button methods that are called when a button is clicked.  
  
-   General methods that are called when data is loaded or saved, or when a screen is closed.  
  
-   Access control methods that are called to verify if a user has permission to perform a task.  
  
-   Collection methods that are called when a collection is modified.  
  
 A description of these methods appears in the tables at the end of this topic.  
  
### To handle a screen event  
  
1.  Open the screen that you want to modify by double clicking it in the **Solution Explorer**.  
  
     The **Screen Designer** opens.  
  
2.  At the top of the **Screen Designer**, click the arrow next to the **Write Code** button, and then select a method. The methods to which you can add custom code appear in the tables below.  
  
     The Code Editor opens.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The **Collection Methods** only appear in the **Write Code** drop-down list if the collection is selected from the left data pane in the **Screen Designer**.  
  
3.  Place your cursor in the method that was just created and type the code that you want to run when the event occurs.
