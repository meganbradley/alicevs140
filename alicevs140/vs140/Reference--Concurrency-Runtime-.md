# Reference (Concurrency Runtime)
This section contains reference information for the Concurrency Runtime.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The C++ language standard reserves the use of identifiers that begin with an underscore (`_`) character for implementations such as libraries. Do not use these names in your code. The behavior of code elements whose names follow this convention are not guaranteed and are subject to change in future releases. For these reasons, such code elements are omitted from the Concurrency Runtime documentation.  
  
## In This Section  
 [concurrency Namespace](../vs140/concurrency-Namespace.md)  
 The `concurrency` namespace provides classes and functions that give you access to the Concurrency Runtime, a concurrent programming framework for C++. For more information, see [Concurrency Runtime](../vs140/Concurrency-Runtime.md).
