# deque::rend
Returns an iterator that addresses the location succeeding the last element in a reversed deque.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      const_reverse_iterator rend( ) const;   
reverse_iterator rend( );  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 A reverse random-access iterator that addresses the location succeeding the last element in a reversed deque (the location that had preceded the first element in the unreversed deque).  
  
## Remarks  
 `rend` is used with a reversed deque just as [end](../vs140/deque--end.md) is used with a deque.  
  
 If the return value of `rend` is assigned to a `const_reverse_iterator`, the deque object cannot be modified. If the return value of `rend` is assigned to a `reverse_iterator`, the deque object can be modified.  
  
 `rend` can be used to test whether a reverse iterator has reached the end of its deque.  
  
 The value returned by `rend` should not be dereferenced.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// deque_rend.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <deque>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )   
{  
   using namespace std;  
  
   deque <int> c1;  
   deque <int>::iterator c1_Iter;  
   deque <int>::reverse_iterator c1_rIter;  
   // If the following line had replaced the line above, an error  
   // would have resulted in the line modifying an element  
   // (commented below) because the iterator would have been const  
   // deque <int>::const_reverse_iterator c1_rIter;  
  
   c1.push_back( 10 );  
   c1.push_back( 20 );  
   c1.push_back( 30 );  
  
   c1_rIter = c1.rend( );  
   c1_rIter --; // Decrementing a reverse iterator moves it forward   
                // in the deque (to point to the first element here)  
   cout << "The first element in the deque is: " << *c1_rIter << endl;  
  
   cout << "The deque is: ";  
   for ( c1_Iter = c1.begin( ); c1_Iter != c1.end( ); c1_Iter++ )  
      cout << *c1_Iter << " ";  
   cout << endl;  
  
   // rend can be used to test if an iteration is through all of   
   // the elements of a reversed deque  
   cout << "The reversed deque is: ";  
   for ( c1_rIter = c1.rbegin( ); c1_rIter != c1.rend( ); c1_rIter++ )  
      cout << *c1_rIter << " ";  
   cout << endl;  
  
   c1_rIter = c1.rend( );  
   c1_rIter--; // Decrementing the reverse iterator moves it backward   
               // in the reversed deque (to the last element here)  
   *c1_rIter = 40; // This modification of the last element would   
                   // have caused an error if a const_reverse   
                   // iterator had been declared (as noted above)  
   cout << "The modified reversed deque is: ";  
   for ( c1_rIter = c1.rbegin( ); c1_rIter != c1.rend( ); c1_rIter++ )  
      cout << *c1_rIter << " ";  
   cout << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The first element in the deque is: 10**  
**The deque is: 10 20 30**   
**The reversed deque is: 30 20 10**   
**The modified reversed deque is: 30 20 40**
