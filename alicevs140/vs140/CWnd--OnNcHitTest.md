# CWnd::OnNcHitTest
The framework calls this member function for the `CWnd` object that contains the cursor (or the `CWnd` object that used the [SetCapture](../vs140/CWnd--SetCapture.md) member function to capture the mouse input) every time the mouse is moved.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg LRESULT OnNcHitTest(  
   CPoint point   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `point`  
 Contains the x- and y-coordinates of the cursor. These coordinates are always screen coordinates.  
  
## Return Value  
 One of the mouse hit-test enumerated values listed below.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
