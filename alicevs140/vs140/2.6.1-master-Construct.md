# 2.6.1 master Construct
The **master** directive identifies a construct that specifies a structured block that is executed by the master thread of the team. The syntax of the **master** directive is as follows:  
  
```  
#pragma omp master new-linestructured-block  
```  
  
 Other threads in the team do not execute the associated structured block. There is no implied barrier either on entry to or exit from the master construct.
