# C Run-Time Library Reference
The Microsoft run-time library provides routines for programming for the Microsoft Windows operating system. These routines automate many common programming tasks that are not provided by the C and C++ languages.  
  
 Sample programs are included in the individual reference topics for most routines in the library.  
  
## In This Section  
 [C Run-Time Libraries](../vs140/CRT-Library-Features.md)  
 Discusses the .lib files that comprise the C run-time libraries.  
  
 [Run-Time Routines by Category](../vs140/Run-Time-Routines-by-Category.md)  
 Provides links to the run-time library by category.  
  
 [Global Variables and Standard Types](../vs140/Global-Variables-and-Standard-Types.md)  
 Provides links to the global variables and standard types provided by the run-time library.  
  
 [Global Constants](../vs140/Global-Constants.md)  
 Provides links to the global constants defined by the run-time library.  
  
 [Alphabetical Function Reference](../vs140/CRT-Alphabetical-Function-Reference.md)  
 Provides a table of contents entry point into an alphabetical listing of all C run-time library functions.  
  
 [Generic-Text Mappings](../vs140/Generic-Text-Mappings.md)  
 Provides links to the generic-text mappings defined in Tchar.h.  
  
 [Language and Country/Region Strings](../vs140/Locale-Names--Languages--and-Country-Region-Strings.md)  
 Describes how to use the `setlocale` function to set the language and Country/Region strings.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Debug Routines](../vs140/Debug-Routines.md)  
 Provides links to the debug versions of the run-time library routines.  
  
 [Run-Time Error Checking](../vs140/Run-Time-Error-Checking.md)  
 Provides links to functions that support run-time error checks.  
  
 [Run-Time Library Behavior](../vs140/Run-Time-Library-Behavior.md)  
 Discusses the entry point into the CRT DLL.  
  
 [Visual C++ Libraries](assetId:///fec23c40-10c0-4857-9cdc-33a3b99b30ae)  
 Provides links to the various libraries provided with Visual C++, including ATL, MFC, OLE DB Templates, the C run-time library, and the Standard C++ Library.  
  
 [Debugging](../vs140/Debugging-in-Visual-Studio.md)  
 Provides links to using the Visual Studio debugger to correct logic errors in your application or stored procedures.
