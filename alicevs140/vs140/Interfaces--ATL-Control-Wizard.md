# Interfaces, ATL Control Wizard
This page of the wizard identifies the interfaces that the control supports. By default, the supported interfaces are those typically used by most containers.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you selected **Minimal control** on the [Options](../vs140/Options--ATL-Control-Wizard.md) tab, no interfaces appear by default in the **Supported** list box.  
  
 **Not supported**  
 Indicates the available interfaces that are not currently supported for the control.  
  
 **Supported**  
 Indicates the interfaces that are currently supported for the control.
