# Dual Interfaces and ATL
A dual interface allows its methods to be accessed as dispinterface methods or as vtable methods. This section covers some of the features of dual interfaces from an ATL perspective.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Implementing a Dual Interface](../vs140/Implementing-a-Dual-Interface.md)  
 Discusses the classes and wizards involved in implementing a dual interface.  
  
 [Multiple Dual Interfaces](../vs140/Multiple-Dual-Interfaces.md)  
 Discusses how to expose multiple dual interfaces on a single object.  
  
 [The nonextensible Attribute](../vs140/nonextensible-Attribute.md)  
 Discusses when to use the **nonextensible** attribute on your interface definition.  
  
 [Dual Interfaces and Events](../vs140/Dual-Interfaces-and-Events.md)  
 Discusses design reasons for not making an event interface a dual interface.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [ATL](../vs140/Active-Template-Library--ATL--Concepts.md)  
 Provides links to conceptual topics on how to program using the Active Template Library.
