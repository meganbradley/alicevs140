# CAnimationController::OnHasPriorityCancel
Called by the framework to resolve scheduling conflicts.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual BOOL OnHasPriorityCancel(  
   CAnimationGroup* pGroupScheduled,  
   CAnimationGroup* pGroupNew,  
   UI_ANIMATION_PRIORITY_EFFECT priorityEffect  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pGroupScheduled`  
 The group that owns the currently scheduled storyboard.  
  
 `pGroupNew`  
 The group that owns the new storyboard that is in scheduling conflict with the scheduled storyboard owned by pGroupScheduled.  
  
 `priorityEffect`  
 The potential effect on pGroupNew if pGroupScheduled has a higher priority.  
  
## Return Value  
 Should return TRUE if storyboard owned by pGroupNew has priority. Should return FALSE if storyboard owned by pGroupScheduled has priority.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method is called if you enable priority comparison events using CAnimationController::EnablePriorityComparisonHandler and specify UI_ANIMATION_PHT_CANCEL. It can be overridden in a derived class to take application-specific actions. Read Windows Animation API documentation for more information about Conflict Management (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd371759(VS.85).aspx).
