# How to: Build Isolated Applications to Consume COM Components
Isolated applications are applications that have manifests built into the program. You can create isolated applications to consume COM components.  
  
### To add COM references to manifests of isolated applications  
  
1.  Open the project property pages for the isolated application.  
  
2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node, and then expand the **Manifest Tool** node.  
  
3.  Select the **Isolated COM** property page, and then set the **Component File Name** property to the name of the COM component that you want the isolated application to consume.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
### To build manifests into isolated applications  
  
1.  Open the project property pages for the isolated application.  
  
2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node, and then expand the **Manifest Tool** node.  
  
3.  Select the **Input and Output** property page, and then set the **Embed Manifest** property equal to **Yes**.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
5.  Build the solution.
