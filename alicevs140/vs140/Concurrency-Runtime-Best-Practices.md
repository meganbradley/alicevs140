# Concurrency Runtime Best Practices
This section describes best practices that can help you make effective use of the Concurrency Runtime. These best practices apply to the [Parallel Patterns Library](../vs140/Parallel-Patterns-Library--PPL-.md) (PPL), the [Asynchronous Agents Library](../vs140/Asynchronous-Agents-Library.md), and the [Task Scheduler](../vs140/Task-Scheduler--Concurrency-Runtime-.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Best Practices in the Parallel Patterns Library](../vs140/Best-Practices-in-the-Parallel-Patterns-Library.md)  
 Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL).  
  
 [Best Practices in the Asynchronous Agents Library](../vs140/Best-Practices-in-the-Asynchronous-Agents-Library.md)  
 Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Asynchronous Agents Library.  
  
 [General Best Practices in the Concurrency Runtime](../vs140/General-Best-Practices-in-the-Concurrency-Runtime.md)  
 Describes best practices that apply to multiple areas of the Concurrency Runtime.
