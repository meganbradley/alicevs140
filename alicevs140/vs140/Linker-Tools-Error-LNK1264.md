# Linker Tools Error LNK1264
/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT specified but no code generation required; instrumentation failed  
  
 **/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT** was specified but no .obj files were found that were compiled with [/GL](../Topic/-GL%20\(Whole%20Program%20Optimization\).md). Instrumentation cannot take place and the link failed. There must be at least one .obj file on the command line that is compiled with **/GL** so that the instrumentation can occur.  
  
 Profile guided optimization (PGO) is only available in 64-bit compilers.
