# 3.1.2 omp_get_num_threads Function
The **omp_get_num_threads** function returns the number of threads currently in the team executing the parallel region from which it is called. The format is as follows:  
  
```  
#include <omp.h>  
int omp_get_num_threads(void);  
```  
  
 The **num_threads** clause, the **omp_set_num_threads** function, and the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable control the number of threads in a team.  
  
 If the number of threads has not been explicitly set by the user, the default is implementation-defined. This function binds to the closest enclosing **parallel** directive. If called from a serial portion of a program, or from a nested parallel region that is serialized, this function returns 1.
