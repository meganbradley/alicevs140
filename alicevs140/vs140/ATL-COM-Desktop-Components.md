# ATL COM Desktop Components
The ATL Reference documents the Active Template Library (ATL), a set of template-based C++ classes that simplify the programming of Component Object Model (COM) objects. To fully take advantage of ATL, a working familiarity with COM is highly recommended.

 Provides reference material on the classes organized alphabetically.  
  
 [ATL Functions](../vs140/ATL-Functions.md)  
 Provides reference material on the global functions organized alphabetically. Includes topics organizing the functions into categories.
