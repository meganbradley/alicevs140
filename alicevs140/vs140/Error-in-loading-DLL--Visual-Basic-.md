# Error in loading DLL (Visual Basic)
A dynamic-link library (DLL) is a library specified in the `Lib` clause of a `Declare` statement. Possible causes for this error include:  
  
-   The file is not DLL executable.  
  
-   The file is not a Microsoft Windows DLL.  
  
-   The DLL references another DLL that is not present.  
  
-   The DLL or referenced DLL is not in a directory specified in the path.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If the file is a source-text file and therefore not DLL executable, it must be compiled and linked to a DLL-executable form.  
  
-   If the file is not a Microsoft Windows DLL, obtain the Microsoft Windows equivalent.  
  
-   If the DLL references another DLL that is not present, obtain the referenced DLL and make it available.  
  
-   If the DLL or referenced DLL is not in a directory specified by the path, move the DLL to a referenced directory.
