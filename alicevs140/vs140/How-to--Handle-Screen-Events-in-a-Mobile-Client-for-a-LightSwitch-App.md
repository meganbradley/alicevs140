# How to: Handle Screen Events in a Mobile Client for a LightSwitch App
As you develop an HTML mobile client in LightSwitch app, you can write JavaScript code that runs when a user initiates a certain event. For example, you can write code that runs when a user chooses a button on a screen in your client.  
  
 You can write the following kinds of methods to run when a user takes a certain action:  
  
-   Button methods run when a user chooses a button.  
  
-   General methods run when a user loads data, saves data, or closes a screen.  
  
-   Access control methods run when a user tries to perform a task that requires certain permissions.  
  
 For more information about these kinds of methods, see the tables after the following procedure.  
  
### To handle an event  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, open the screen that you want to modify.  
  
     The **Screen Designer** opens.  
  
2.  On the **Screen Designer** toolbar, open the **Write Code** list, and then choose the appropriate method  
  
     The Code Editor opens.  
  
3.  In the new method, enter the code that you want to run when the event occurs.  
  
## Screen Event Methods  
 The following tables list methods that can run when a user interacts with a screen. All of these methods run on the client tier.  
  
|Button Method|Description|  
|-------------------|-----------------|  
|*ButtonName*_execute|Called when a user chooses the button that’s associated with the method. Applies only to buttons based on custom methods.|
