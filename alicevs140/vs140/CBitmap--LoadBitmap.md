# CBitmap::LoadBitmap
Loads the bitmap resource named by `lpszResourceName` or identified by the ID number in `nIDResource` from the application's executable file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL LoadBitmap(  
   LPCTSTR lpszResourceName   
);  
BOOL LoadBitmap(  
   UINT nIDResource   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpszResourceName`  
 Points to a null-terminated string that contains the name of the bitmap resource.  
  
 `nIDResource`  
 Specifies the resource ID number of the bitmap resource.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The loaded bitmap is attached to the `CBitmap` object.  
  
 If the bitmap identified by `lpszResourceName` does not exist or if there is insufficient memory to load the bitmap, the function returns 0.  
  
 You can use the [CGdiObject::DeleteObject](../vs140/CGdiObject--DeleteObject.md) function to delete bitmap loaded by the `LoadBitmap` function, or the `CBitmap` destructor will delete the object for you.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Before you delete the object, make sure it is not selected into a device context.  
  
 The following bitmaps were added to Windows versions 3.1 and later:  
  
 **OBM_UPARRROWIOBM_DNARROWIOBM_RGARROWIOBM_LFARROWI**  
  
 These bitmaps are not found in device drivers for Windows versions 3.0 and earlier. For a complete list of bitmaps and a display of their appearance, see the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)].
