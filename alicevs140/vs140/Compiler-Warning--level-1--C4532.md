# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4532
'continue' : jump out of __finally/finally block has undefined behavior during termination handling  
  
 The compiler encountered one of the following keywords:  
  
-   [continue](../vs140/continue-Statement--C---.md)  
  
-   [break](../vs140/break-Statement--C---.md)  
  
-   [goto](../vs140/goto-Statement--C---.md)  
  
 causing a jump out of a [__finally](../vs140/try-finally-Statement.md) or [finally](../vs140/finally.md) block during abnormal termination.  
  
 If an exception occurs, and while the stack is being unwound during execution of the termination handlers (the `__finally` or finally blocks), and your code jumps out of a `__finally` block before the `__finally` block ends, the behavior is undefined. Control may not return to the unwinding code, so the exception may not be handled properly.  
  
 If you must jump out of a **__finally** block, check for abnormal termination first.  
  
 The following sample generates C4532; simply comment out the jump statements to resolve the warnings.  
  
```  
// C4532.cpp  
// compile with: /W1  
// C4532 expected  
int main() {  
   int i;  
   for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  
      __try {  
      } __finally {  
         // Delete the following line to resolve.  
         continue;  
      }  
  
      __try {  
      } __finally {  
         // Delete the following line to resolve.  
         break;  
      }  
   }  
}  
```
