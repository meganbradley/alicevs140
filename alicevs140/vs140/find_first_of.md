# find_first_of
Searches for the first occurrence of any of several values within a target range or for the first occurrence of any of several elements that are equivalent in a sense specified by a binary predicate to a specified set of the elements.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      template<class ForwardIterator1, class ForwardIterator2>  
   ForwardIterator1 find_first_of(  
      ForwardIterator1 _First1,   
      ForwardIterator1 _Last1,  
      ForwardIterator2 _First2,   
      ForwardIterator2 _Last2  
   );  
template<class ForwardIterator1, class ForwardIterator2, class BinaryPredicate>  
   ForwardIterator1 find_first_of(  
      ForwardIterator1 _First1,   
      ForwardIterator1 _Last1,  
      ForwardIterator2 _First2,   
      ForwardIterator2 _Last2,  
      BinaryPredicate _Comp  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_First1`  
 A forward iterator addressing the position of the first element in the range to be searched.  
  
 `_Last1`  
 A forward iterator addressing the position one past the final element in the range to be searched.  
  
 `_First2`  
 A forward iterator addressing the position of the first element in the range to be matched.  
  
 `_Last2`  
 A forward iterator addressing the position one past the final element in the range to be matched.  
  
 `_Comp`  
 User-defined predicate function object that defines the condition to be satisfied if two elements are to be taken as equivalent. A binary predicate takes two arguments and returns **true** when satisfied and **false** when not satisfied.  
  
## Return Value  
 A forward iterator addressing the position of the first element of the first subsequence that matches the specified sequence or that is equivalent in a sense specified by a binary predicate.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `operator==` used to determine the match between an element and the specified value must impose an equivalence relation between its operands.  
  
 The ranges referenced must be valid; all pointers must be dereferenceable and, within each sequence, the last position is reachable from the first by incrementation.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// alg_find_first_of.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <vector>  
#include <list>  
#include <algorithm>  
#include <iostream>  
  
// Return whether second element is twice the first  
bool twice ( int elem1, int elem2 )  
{  
   return 2 * elem1 == elem2;  
}

           << result2 - v1.begin( ) << "." << endl;

 **Vector v1 = ( 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 )**

**Vector v2 = ( 20 30 40 )**  
**There is at least one match of L1 in v1**  
 **and the first one begins at position 3.**  
**There is a sequence of elements in v1 that are equivalent**  
 **to those in v2 under the binary predicate twice**  
 **and the first one begins at position 2.**
