# CAnimationController::RemoveAllAnimationGroups
Removes all animation groups from animation controller.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void RemoveAllAnimationGroups();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 All groups will be deleted, their pointer, if stored at the application level, must be invalidated. If CAnimationGroup::m_bAutodestroyAnimationObjects for a group being deleted is TRUE, all animation objects that belong to that group will be deleted; otherwise their references to parent animation controller will be set to NULL and they can be added to another controller.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxanimationcontroller.h
