# Compiler Error CS0148
The delegate 'delegate' does not have a valid constructor  
  
 You imported and used a managed program (one that uses the .NET Framework common language runtime) that was created with another compiler. That compiler allowed an ill-formed [delegate](../vs140/delegate--C#-Reference-.md) constructor. For more information, see [Delegates (C# Programmer's Reference)](../Topic/Delegates%20\(C%23%20Programming%20Guide\).md).
