# CAsyncSocket::Accept
Call this member function to accept a connection on a socket.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual BOOL Accept(  
   CAsyncSocket& rConnectedSocket,  
   SOCKADDR* lpSockAddr = NULL,  
   int* lpSockAddrLen = NULL   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `rConnectedSocket`  
 A reference identifying a new socket that is available for connection.  
  
 `lpSockAddr`  
 A pointer to a [SOCKADDR](../vs140/SOCKADDR-Structure.md) structure that receives the address of the connecting socket, as known on the network. The exact format of the `lpSockAddr` argument is determined by the address family established when the socket was created. If `lpSockAddr` and/or `lpSockAddrLen` are equal to **NULL**, then no information about the remote address of the accepted socket is returned.  
  
 `lpSockAddrLen`  
 A pointer to the length of the address in `lpSockAddr` in bytes. The `lpSockAddrLen` is a value-result parameter: it should initially contain the amount of space pointed to by `lpSockAddr`; on return it will contain the actual length (in bytes) of the address returned.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0, and a specific error code can be retrieved by calling [GetLastError](../vs140/CAsyncSocket--GetLastError.md). The following errors apply to this member function:  
  
-   **WSANOTINITIALISED** A successful [AfxSocketInit](../vs140/AfxSocketInit.md) must occur before using this API.  
  
-   **WSAENETDOWN** The Windows Sockets implementation detected that the network subsystem failed.  
  
-   **WSAEFAULT** The `lpSockAddrLen` argument is too small (less than the size of a [SOCKADDR](../vs140/SOCKADDR-Structure.md) structure).  
  
-   **WSAEINPROGRESS** A blocking Windows Sockets call is in progress.  
  
-   **WSAEINVAL** `Listen` was not invoked prior to accept.  
  
-   **WSAEMFILE** The queue is empty upon entry to accept and there are no descriptors available.  
  
-   `WSAENOBUFS` No buffer space is available.  
  
-   **WSAENOTSOCK** The descriptor is not a socket.  
  
-   **WSAEOPNOTSUPP** The referenced socket is not a type that supports connection-oriented service.  
  
-   **WSAEWOULDBLOCK** The socket is marked as nonblocking and no connections are present to be accepted.  
  
## Remarks  
 This routine extracts the first connection in the queue of pending connections, creates a new socket with the same properties as this socket, and attaches it to `rConnectedSocket`. If no pending connections are present on the queue, **Accept** returns zero and `GetLastError` returns an error. The accepted socket (*rConnectedSocket)* cannot be used to accept more connections. The original socket remains open and listening.  
  
 The argument `lpSockAddr` is a result parameter that is filled in with the address of the connecting socket, as known to the communications layer. **Accept** is used with connection-based socket types such as **SOCK_STREAM**.
