# Device unavailable
Either you have lost your network connection, or the device that you are trying to access is offline or does not exist.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check power to the device and any cables connecting your computer to the device. If you are trying to access a printer over a network, make sure there is a logical connection between your computer and the printer, for example, a connection associating LPT1 with the network printer ID.  
  
2.  Reconnect to the network and try again.
