# Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova
Build apps that run on iOS, Android, and Windows devices and share nearly 100% of your code. Build them with your favorite web technologies. Apache Cordova gives you native access to device capabilities like the camera on a phone, and best of all, itâ€™s free. Visual Studio adds these extras to make it even easier to build your app:  
  
-   Easy installation and setup.  
  
-   Advanced debugger to help you find and fix problems.  
  
-   Easy access to device emulators.  
  
-   A designer to manage your device plug-ins.  
  
-   A project that is completely compatible with the command line interface.
