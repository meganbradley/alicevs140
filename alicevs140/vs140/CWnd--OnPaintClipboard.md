# CWnd::OnPaintClipboard
A Clipboard owner's `OnPaintClipboard` member function is called by a Clipboard viewer when the Clipboard owner has placed data on the Clipboard in the `CF_OWNERDISPLAY` format and the Clipboard viewer's client area needs repainting.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnPaintClipboard(  
   CWnd* pClipAppWnd,  
   HGLOBAL hPaintStruct   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pClipAppWnd`  
 Specifies a pointer to the Clipboard-application window. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored for later use.  
  
 *hPaintStruct*  
 Identifies a [PAINTSTRUCT](../vs140/PAINTSTRUCT-Structure.md) data structure that defines what part of the client area to paint.  
  
## Remarks  
 To determine whether the entire client area or just a portion of it needs repainting, the Clipboard owner must compare the dimensions of the drawing area given in the **rcpaint** member of the `PAINTSTRUCT` structure to the dimensions given in the most recent [OnSizeClipboard](../vs140/CWnd--OnSizeClipboard.md) member function call.  
  
 `OnPaintClipboard` should use the [GlobalLock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366584) Windows function to lock the memory that contains the `PAINTSTRUCT` data structure and unlock that memory with the [GlobalUnlock](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366595) Windows function before it exits.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
