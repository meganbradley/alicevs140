# Fatal Error C1205
Generics are not supported by the version of the runtime installed  
  
 The version of the common language runtime that the compiler is using is not a version of the runtime supported by the current compiler.  For example, the generics feature requires a runtime that is matched to the compiler.  
  
 Your path specification may need to be modified.
