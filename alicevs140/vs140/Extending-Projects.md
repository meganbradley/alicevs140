# Extending Projects
Projects and solutions are the ways Visual Studio organizes code and resource files into compilation and deployment units. You can find more information about projects in [Projects (Visual Studio SDK)](../vs140/Extending-Projects.md).  
  
 You can create your own project types with the Visual Studio SDK and the Managed Package Framework for Projects, which you can download at [Managed Package Framework for Projects](http://mpfproj12.codeplex.com/). To understand how custom projects are implemented, see [New Project Generation: Under the Hood, Part One](../vs140/New-Project-Generation--Under-the-Hood--Part-One.md) and [New Project Generation: Under the Hood, Part Two](../vs140/New-Project-Generation--Under-the-Hood--Part-Two.md).  
  
 The topics in this section describe how to create custom projects and how to manage different types of Visual Studio solution.
