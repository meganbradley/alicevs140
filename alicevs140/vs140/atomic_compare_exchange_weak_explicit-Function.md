# atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit Function
Performs a *weak atomic compare and exchange* operation.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template <class Ty>  
inline bool atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(  
   volatile atomic<Ty> *Atom,  
   Ty *Exp,  
   Ty Value,  
   memory_order Order1,  
   memory_order Order2  
) _NOEXCEPT;  
template <class Ty>  
inline bool atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(  
   atomic<Ty> *Atom,  
   Ty *Exp,  
   Ty Value,  
   memory_order Order1,  
   memory_order Order2  
) _NOEXCEPT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Atom`  
 A pointer to an `atomic` object that stores a value of type `Ty`.  
  
 `Exp`  
 A pointer to a value of type `Ty`.  
  
 `Value`  
 A value of type `Ty`.  
  
 `Order1`  
 First [memory_order](../vs140/memory_order-Enum.md) argument.  
  
 `Order2`  
 Second `memory_order` argument. The value of `Order2` cannot be `memory_order_release` or `memory_order_acq_rel`, nor can it be stronger than the value of `Order1`.  
  
## Return Value  
 A `bool` that indicates the result of the value comparison.  
  
## Remarks  
 An *atomic compare and exchange operation* compares the value that is stored in the object that is pointed to by `Atom` with the value that is pointed to by `Exp`. If the values are equal, the operation replaces the value that is stored in the object that is pointed to by `Atom` with `Val` by using a `read-modify-write` operation and applying the memory-order constraints that are specified by `Order1`. If the values are not equal, the operation replaces the value that is pointed to by `Exp` with the value that is stored in the object that is pointed to by `Atom` and applies the memory-order constraints that are specified by `Order2`.  
  
 A *weak* atomic compare and exchange operation performs an exchange if the compared values are equal. However, if the values are not equal, the operation is not guaranteed to perform an exchange.
