# texture::get_depth_pitch Method
Returns the number of bytes between each depth slice in a 3D staging texture on the CPU.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
unsigned int get_depth_pitch() const restrict(cpu);  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 The number of bytes between each depth slice in a 3D staging texture on the CPU.  
  
## Remarks  
 Given the address of any element in the first depth slice of the staging texture, you can add `depth_pitch` to calculate the address of the same element in the second depth slice of the same texture, and similarly for subsequent depth slices. The value of `depth_pitch` compensates for the size of the texture elements as well as any additional padding that might exist between depth slices and between rows within each depth slice.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** amp_graphics.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency::graphics
