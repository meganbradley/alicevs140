# Project Type Not Available
This dialog box appears with the error "The project <project\> cannot be opened because its project type <project type\> is not supported by this version of the application."  
  
## Workaround  
  
-   This dialog box appears because a product or product version required to open the specified file was not found. It is common for this error to occur when attempting to open a project file that cannot be opened with the installed version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. For example, attempting to open a [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../vs140/includes/csprcs_md.md)] project file with [!INCLUDE[vbprvbxprlong](../vs140/includes/vbprvbxprlong_md.md)] will open this dialog box.  
  
#### To work around this error  
  
-   Install the correct version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].
