# Troubleshooting Snippets
Problems with IntelliSense code snippets are typically caused by two problems: a corrupt snippet file or bad content in the snippet file.  
  
## Common Problems  
  
### The Snippet Cannot Be Dragged from File Explorer to a Visual Studio Source File  
  
-   The XML in the snippet file may be corrupt. The **XML Editor** in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] can locate problems in the XML structure.  
  
-   The snippet file may not conform to the snippet schema. The **XML Editor** in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] can locate problems in the XML structure.  
  
### The Code Has Compiler Errors That Are Not Highlighted  
  
-   You may be missing a project reference. Examine the documentation about the snippet. If the reference is not found on the computer, you will need to install it. Inserting a snippet should add to the project any references needed. If the snippet is missing the reference information, that can be reported to the snippet creator as an error.  
  
-   A variable may be undefined. Undefined variables in a snippet should be highlighted. If not, that can be reported to the snippet creator as an error.
