# Removing Space Between Buttons on a Toolbar
The following procedure shows you how to remove a space between buttons on a toolbar.  
  
### To remove a space between buttons on a toolbar  
  
1.  Drag the button on one side of the space toward the button on the other side of the space until it overlaps the next button about halfway.  
  
     If there is no space on the side of the button that you are dragging away from, and you drag the button more than halfway past the adjacent button, the Toolbar editor also inserts a space on the opposite side of the button that you are dragging.
