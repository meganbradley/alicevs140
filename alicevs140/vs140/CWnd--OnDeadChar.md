# CWnd::OnDeadChar
The framework calls this member function when the [OnKeyUp](../vs140/CWnd--OnKeyUp.md) member function and the [OnKeyDown](../vs140/CWnd--OnKeyDown.md) member functions are called.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnDeadChar(  
   UINT nChar,  
   UINT nRepCnt,  
   UINT nFlags   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nChar`  
 Specifies the dead-key character value.  
  
 `nRepCnt`  
 Specifies the repeat count.  
  
 `nFlags`  
 Specifies the scan code, key-transition code, previous key state, and context code, as shown in the following list:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|0–7|Scan code (OEM-dependent value). Low byte of high-order word.|  
|8|Extended key, such as a function key or a key on the numeric keypad (1 if it is an extended key; otherwise 0).|  
|9–10|Not used.|  
|11–12|Used internally by Windows.|  
|13|Context code (1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise 0).|  
|14|Previous key state (1 if the key is down before the call, 0 if the key is up).|  
|15|Transition state (1 if the key is being released, 0 if the key is being pressed).|  
  
## Remarks  
 This member function can be used to specify the character value of a dead key. A dead key is a key, such as the umlaut (double-dot) character, that is combined with other characters to form a composite character. For example, the umlaut-O character consists of the dead key, umlaut, and the O key.  
  
 An application typically uses `OnDeadChar` to give the user feedback about each key pressed. For example, an application can display the accent in the current character position without moving the caret.  
  
 Since there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between keys pressed and `OnDeadChar` calls, the information in `nFlags` is generally not useful to applications. The information in `nFlags` applies only to the most recent call to the [OnKeyUp](../vs140/CWnd--OnKeyUp.md) member function or the [OnKeyDown](../vs140/CWnd--OnKeyDown.md) member function that precedes the `OnDeadChar` call.  
  
 For IBM Enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, enhanced keys are the right ALT and the right CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the slash (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Some other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in `nFlags`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
