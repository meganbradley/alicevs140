# How to: Use Extensions in a LightSwitch Project
You use different types of extensions in different ways. Custom data type extensions appear in the **Type** list in the Data designer when you choose a compatible data type. For example, the `Image` custom data type extension becomes available when you choose the `Binary` data type.  
  
 Custom control extensions appear in **Screen Content Tree** lists in the Screen designer. For example, a custom `Masked Edit` control appears wherever a **TextBox** is available. The following procedures describe how to use theme and shell extensions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Extensions are only available in Silverlight client projects.  
  
 Extensions are available only if they're enabled in the **Extensions** tab of the Application designer. See [How to: Add or Remove Extensions](../vs140/How-to--Add-or-Remove-Extensions.md).  
  
### To apply a theme extension  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the **Properties** node, and then choose **Open**.  
  
     In the Application designer, choose the **General Properties** tab, and then choose the **Edit Client properties** link.  
  
2.  In the **Theme** list, choose the extension that you want to apply.  
  
### To apply a shell extension  
  
1.  In the Client designer, choose the **Client Properties** tab, open the **Shell** list, and then choose the extension that you want to apply.
