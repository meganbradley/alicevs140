# Associating Menu Commands with Status Bar Text in MFC Applications
Your application can display descriptive text for each of the menu commands a user may select. You do this by assigning a text string to each menu command using the **Prompt** property in the Properties window. If you have a string in the [string table](../vs140/String-Editor.md) whose ID is the same as the command, an MFC application will automatically display this string resource in the status bar of the running application when a user hovers over a menu item.  
  
### To associate a menu command with a status bar text string  
  
1.  In the **Menu** editor, select the menu command.  
  
2.  In the [Properties Window](../vs140/Properties-Window.md), type the associated status bar text in the **Prompt** box.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](assetId:///8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](assetId:///bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
