# Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.ServiceModel.ServerTooBusyException
A <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServerTooBusyException?qualifyHint=False> exception is thrown when a server is too busy to accept a message.  
  
## Remarks  
 This exception derives from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException?qualifyHint=False> that represents a class of recoverable errors that might be thrown during communication between endpoints. Robust client and service [!INCLUDE[vsindigo](../vs140/includes/vsindigo_md.md)] applications are expected to handle these exceptions. To prevent a handler for <xref:System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException?qualifyHint=False> from catching the more specific <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServerTooBusyException?qualifyHint=False>, catch this exception prior to handling <xref:System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException?qualifyHint=False>.
