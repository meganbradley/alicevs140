# collate::do_transform
A virtual function called to convert a character sequence from a locale to a string that may be used in lexicographical comparisons with other character sequences similarly converted from the same locale.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual string  
      _  
      type do  
      _  
      transform(  
   const CharType* _First,  
   const CharType* _Last  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_First`  
 A pointer to the first character in the sequence to be converted.  
  
 `_Last`  
 A pointer to the last character in the sequence to be converted.  
  
## Return Value  
 A string that is the transformed character sequence.  
  
## Remarks  
 The protected virtual member function returns an object of class [string_type](../vs140/collate--string_type.md) whose controlled sequence is a copy of the sequence [`_First`, `_Last`). If a class derived from collate<**CharType**> overrides [do_compare](../vs140/collate--do_compare.md), it should also override `do_transform` to match. When passed to `collate::compare`, two transformed strings should yield the same result that you would get from passing the untransformed strings to compare in the derived class.  
  
## Example  
 See the example for [transform](../vs140/collate--transform.md), which calls `do_transform`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <locale\>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
