# merge
Combines all of the elements from two sorted source ranges into a single, sorted destination range, where the ordering criterion may be specified by a binary predicate.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator>  
   OutputIterator merge(  
      InputIterator1 _First1,   
      InputIterator1 _Last1,  
      InputIterator2 _First2,   
      InputIterator2 _Last2,   
      OutputIterator _Result  
   );  
template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator, class BinaryPredicate>  
   OutputIterator merge(  
      InputIterator1 _First1,   
      InputIterator1 _Last1,  
      InputIterator2 _First2,   
      InputIterator2 _Last2,   
      OutputIterator _Result  
      BinaryPredicate _Comp  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_First1`  
 An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in the first of two sorted source ranges to be combined and sorted into a single range.  
  
 `_Last1`  
 An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in the first of two sorted source ranges to be combined and sorted into a single range.  
  
 `_First2`  
 An input iterator addressing the position of the first element in second of two consecutive sorted source ranges to be combined and sorted into a single range.  
  
 `_Last2`  
 An input iterator addressing the position one past the last element in second of two consecutive sorted source ranges to be combined and sorted into a single range.  
  
 `_Result`  
 An output iterator addressing the position of the first element in the destination range where the two source ranges are to be combined into a single sorted range.  
  
 `_Comp`  
 User-defined predicate function object that defines the sense in which one element is greater than another. The binary predicate takes two arguments and should return **true** when the first element is less than the second element and **false** otherwise.  
  
## Return Value  
 An output iterator addressing the position one past the last element in the sorted destination range.  
  
## Remarks  
 The sorted source ranges referenced must be valid; all pointers must be dereferenceable and within each sequence the last position must be reachable from the first by incrementation.  
  
 The destination range should not overlap either of the source ranges and should be large enough to contain the destination range.  
  
 The sorted source ranges must each be arranged as a precondition to the application of the **merge** algorithm in accordance with the same ordering as is to be used by the algorithm to sort the combined ranges.  
  
 The operation is stable as the relative order of elements within each range is preserved in the destination range. The source ranges are not modified by the algorithm **merge**.  
  
 The value types of the input iterators need be less-than comparable to be ordered, so that, given two elements, it may be determined either that they are equivalent (in the sense that neither is less than the other) or that one is less than the other. This results in an ordering between the nonequivalent elements. When there are equivalent elements in both source ranges, the elements in the first range precede the elements from the second source range in the destination range.  
  
 The complexity of the algorithm is linear with at most (*_Last1 – _First1*) – (*_Last2 – _First2*) – 1 comparisons.  
  
 The [list](../vs140/list-Class.md) class provides a member function [merge](../vs140/list--merge.md) to merge the elements of two lists.  
  
 `merge` has two related forms:  
  
 [checked_merge](assetId:///48c4d215-e7e2-4ae6-94a2-68a17319d28f)  
  
 [unchecked_merge](assetId:///a82bb917-0d83-4959-9c8f-a73548e6162f)  
  
 For information on how these functions behave, see [Checked Iterators](../vs140/Checked-Iterators.md).

// Return whether modulus of elem1 is less than modulus of elem2  
bool mod_lesser ( int elem1, int elem2 ) {  
   if (elem1 < 0)   
      elem1 = - elem1;  
   if (elem2 < 0)   
      elem2 = - elem2;  
   return elem1 < elem2;
