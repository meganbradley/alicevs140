# Declaration expected
A nondeclarative statement, such as an assignment or loop statement, occurs outside any procedure. Only declarations are allowed outside procedures.  
  
 Alternatively, a programming element is declared without a declaration keyword such as `Dim` or `Const`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30188  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Move the nondeclarative statement to the body of a procedure.  
  
-   Begin the declaration with an appropriate declaration keyword.  
  
-   Ensure that a declaration keyword is not misspelled.
