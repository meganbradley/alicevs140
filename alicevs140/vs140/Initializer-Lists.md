# Initializer Lists
Initializer lists in constructors are now called before the base class constructor.  
  
## Remarks  
 Prior to Visual C++ 2005, the base class constructor was called before the initializer list when compiling with Managed Extensions for C++. Now, when compiling with **/clr**, the initializer list is called first.
