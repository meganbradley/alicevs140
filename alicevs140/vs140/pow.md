# pow
Evaluates the complex number obtained by raising a base that is a complex number to the power of another complex number.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> pow(  
      const complex<Type>& _Base,   
      int _Power  
   );  
template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> pow(  
      const complex<Type>& _Base,  
      const Type& _Power  
   );  
template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> pow(  
      const complex<Type>& _Base,  
      const complex<Type>& _Power  
   );  
template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> pow(  
      const Type& _Base,  
      const complex<Type>& _Power  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Base`  
 The complex number or number that is of the parameter type for the complex number that is the base to be raised to a power by the member function.  
  
 *_Power*  
 The integer or complex number or number that is of the parameter type for the complex number that is the power that the base is to be raised to by the member function.  
  
## Return Value  
 The complex number obtained by raising the specified base to the specified power.  
  
## Remarks  
 The functions each effectively convert both operands to the return type, and then return the converted **left** to the power **right**.  
  
 The branch cut is along the negative real axis.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// complex_pow.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <complex>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;

   // First member function  
   // type complex<double> base & type integer power  
   complex <double> cb1 ( 3 , 4);  
   int cp1 = 2;  
   complex <double> ce1 = pow ( cb1 ,cp1 );  
  
   cout << "Complex number for base cb1 = " << cb1 << endl;  
   cout << "Integer for power = " << cp1 << endl;

        << argce1 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;   
  
   // Second member function  
   // type complex<double> base & type double power  
   complex <double> cb2 ( 3 , 4 );

   cout << "The argument of ce2 is: "<< argce2 << " radians, which is "   
        << argce2 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;  
  
   // Third member function  
   // type complex<double> base & type complex<double> power  
   complex <double> cb3 ( 3 , 4 );  
   complex <double> cp3 ( -2 , 1 );  
   complex <double> ce3 = pow ( cb3 ,cp3 );  
  
   cout << "Complex number for base cb3 = " << cb3 << endl;  
   cout << "Complex number for power cp3= " << cp3 << endl;  
   cout << "Complex number returned from complex base and complex power:"  
        << "\n ce3 = cb3 ^ cp3 = " << ce3 << endl;

   double argce3 = arg ( ce3 );  
   cout << "The modulus of ce3 is: " << absce3 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of ce3 is: "<< argce3 << " radians, which is "   
        << argce3 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;   
  
   // Fourth member function  
   // type double base & type complex<double> power  
   double cb4 = pi;  
   complex <double> cp4 ( 2 , -1 );  
   complex <double> ce4 = pow ( cb4 ,cp4 );  
  
   cout << "Type double for base cb4 = pi = " << cb4 << endl;  
   cout << "Complex number for power cp4 = " << cp4 << endl;  
   cout << "Complex number returned from double base and complex power:"  
        << "\n ce4 = cb4 ^ cp4 = " << ce4 << endl;  
   double absce4 = abs ( ce4 );  
   double argce4 = arg ( ce4 );  
   cout << "The modulus of ce4 is: " << absce4 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of ce4 is: "<< argce4 << " radians, which is "   
        << argce4 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;
