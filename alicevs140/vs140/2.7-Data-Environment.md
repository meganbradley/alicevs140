# 2.7 Data Environment
This section presents a directive and several clauses for controlling the data environment during the execution of parallel regions, as follows:  
  
-   A **threadprivate** directive (see the following section) is provided to make file- scope, namespace-scope, or static block-scope variables local to a thread.  
  
-   Clauses that may be specified on the directives to control the sharing attributes of variables for the duration of the parallel or work-sharing constructs are described in [Section 2.7.2](../vs140/2.7.2-Data-Sharing-Attribute-Clauses.md) on page 25.
