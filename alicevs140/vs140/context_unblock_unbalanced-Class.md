# context_unblock_unbalanced Class
This class describes an exception thrown when calls to the             `Block` and             `Unblock` methods of a             `Context` object are not properly paired.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class context_unblock_unbalanced : public std::exception;  
```  
  
## Members

|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[context_unblock_unbalanced::context_unblock_unbalanced Constructor](#context_unblock_unbalanced__context_unblock_unbalanced_constructor)|Overloaded. Constructs a                                         `context_unblock_unbalanced` object.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Calls to the                 `Block` and                 `Unblock` methods of a                 `Context` object must always be properly paired. The Concurrency Runtime allows the operations to happen in either order. For example, a call to                 `Block` can be followed by a call to                 `Unblock`, or vice-versa. This exception would be thrown if, for instance, two calls to the                 `Unblock` method were made in a row, on a                 `Context` object which was not blocked.
