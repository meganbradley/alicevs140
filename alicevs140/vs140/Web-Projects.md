# Web Projects
A Web project system is a project system that creates Web projects. Web projects in turn create Web applications. You can program a Web page using traditional programming languages, such as [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../vs140/includes/csprcs_md.md)], to collect and process information from a user, store it in a database, and so on. Web pages with associated code are called smart Web pages.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Web Project Essentials](../Topic/Web%20Project%20Essentials.md)  
 Presents the important elements [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Web projects.  
  
 [Web Site Support](../vs140/Web-Site-Support.md)  
 Presents an overview of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Web site projects. A Web site project generates one executable file for each smart Web page. Additional executable files are generated from the source code files in the /App_Code folder.
