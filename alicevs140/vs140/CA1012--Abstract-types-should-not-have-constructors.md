## Cause  
 A public type is abstract and has a public constructor.  
  
## Rule Description  
 Constructors on abstract types can be called only by derived types. Because public constructors create instances of a type, and you cannot create instances of an abstract type, an abstract type that has a public constructor is incorrectly designed.  
  
## How to Fix Violations  
 To fix a violation of this rule, either make the constructor protected or do not declare the type as abstract.  
  
## When to Suppress Warnings  
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The abstract type has a public constructor.  
  
## Example  
 The following example contains an abstract type that violates this rule.  
  
 [!CODE [FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad#1](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_CodeAnalysis/FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad#1)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example fixes the previous violation by changing the accessibility of the constructor from `public` to `protected`.
