# CFile::Read
Reads data into a buffer from the file associated with the `CFile` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual UINT Read(  
   void* lpBuf,  
   UINT nCount   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpBuf`  
 Pointer to the user-supplied buffer that is to receive the data read from the file.  
  
 `nCount`  
 The maximum number of bytes to be read from the file. For text-mode files, carriage returnâ€“linefeed pairs are counted as single characters.  
  
## Return Value  
 The number of bytes transferred to the buffer. Note that for all `CFile` classes, the return value may be less than `nCount` if the end of file was reached.  
  
## Example  
 [!CODE [NVC_MFCFiles#15](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_MFCFiles#15)]  
  
 For another example see [CFile::Open](../vs140/CFile--Open.md).
