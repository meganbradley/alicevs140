# Dialog Data Exchange Functions for OLE Controls
This topic lists the DDX_OC functions used to exchange data between a property of an OLE control in a dialog box, form view, or control view object and a data member of the dialog box, form view, or control view object.  
  
### DDX_OC Functions  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[DDX_OCBool](../vs140/DDX_OCBool.md)|Manages the transfer of **BOOL** data between a property of an OLE control and a **BOOL** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCBoolRO](../vs140/DDX_OCBoolRO.md)|Manages the transfer of **BOOL** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **BOOL** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCColor](../vs140/DDX_OCColor.md)|Manages the transfer of **OLE_COLOR** data between a property of an OLE control and an **OLE_COLOR** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCColorRO](../vs140/DDX_OCColorRO.md)|Manages the transfer of **OLE_COLOR** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and an **OLE_COLOR** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCFloat](../vs140/DDX_OCFloat.md)|Manages the transfer of **float** (or **double**) data between a property of an OLE control and a **float** (or **double**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCFloatRO](../vs140/DDX_OCFloatRO.md)|Manages the transfer of **float** (or **double**) data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **float** (or **double**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCInt](../vs140/DDX_OCInt.md)|Manages the transfer of `int` (or **long**) data between a property of an OLE control and an `int` (or **long**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCIntRO](../vs140/DDX_OCIntRO.md)|Manages the transfer of `int` (or **long**) data between a read-only property of an OLE control and an `int` (or **long**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCShort](../vs140/DDX_OCShort.md)|Manages the transfer of **short** data between a property of an OLE control and a **short** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCShortRO](../vs140/DDX_OCShortRO.md)|Manages the transfer of **short** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **short** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCText](../vs140/DDX_OCText.md)|Manages the transfer of **CString** data between a property of an OLE control and a **CString** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCTextRO](../vs140/DDX_OCTextRO.md)|Manages the transfer of **CString** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **CString** data member.|
