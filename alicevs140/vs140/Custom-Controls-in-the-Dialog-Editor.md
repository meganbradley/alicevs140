# Custom Controls in the Dialog Editor
The Dialog editor lets you use existing "custom" or "user" controls in a dialog box template.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Custom controls in this sense are not to be confused with ActiveX controls. ActiveX controls were sometimes called OLE custom controls. Also, don't confuse these controls with the owner-drawn controls in Windows.  
  
 This functionality is intended to let you use controls other than those supplied by Windows. At run time, the control is associated with a window class (not the same as a C++ class). A more common way to accomplish the same task is to install any control, such as a static control, in your dialog box. Then at run time, in the [OnInitDialog](../vs140/CDialog--OnInitDialog.md) function, remove that control and replace it with your own custom control.  
  
 This is an old technique. Today you are advised in most cases to write an ActiveX control or subclass a Windows common control.  
  
 For these custom controls, you are limited to:  
  
-   Setting the location in the dialog box.  
  
-   Typing a caption.  
  
-   Identifying the name of the control's Windows class (your application code must register the control by this name).  
  
-   Typing a 32-bit hexadecimal value that sets the control's style.  
  
-   Setting the extended style.
