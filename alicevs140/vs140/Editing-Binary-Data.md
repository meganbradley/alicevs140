# Editing Binary Data
### To edit a resource in the Binary editor  
  
1.  Select the byte you want to edit.  
  
     The TAB key moves the focus between the hexadecimal and ASCII sections of the Binary editor. You can use the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys to move through the resource one screen at a time.  
  
2.  Type the new value.  
  
     The value changes immediately in both the hexadecimal and ASCII sections and focus shifts to the next value in line.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The Binary editor accepts changes automatically when you close the editor.
