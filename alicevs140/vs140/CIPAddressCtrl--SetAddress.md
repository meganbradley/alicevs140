# CIPAddressCtrl::SetAddress
Sets the address values for all four fields in the IP Address Control.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void SetAddress(  
   BYTE nField0,  
   BYTE nField1,  
   BYTE nField2,  
   BYTE nField3   
);  
void SetAddress(  
   DWORD dwAddress   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nField0`  
 The field 0 value from a packed IP address.  
  
 `nField1`  
 The field 1 value from a packed IP address.  
  
 `nField2`  
 The field 2 value from a packed IP address.  
  
 `nField3`  
 The field 3 value from a packed IP address.  
  
 `dwAddress`  
 A `DWORD` value that contains the new IP address. See **Remarks** for a table that shows how the `DWORD` value is filled.  
  
## Remarks  
 This member function implements the behavior of the Win32 message [IPM_SETADDRESS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761380), as described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)]. In the first prototype above, the numbers in fields 0 through 3 of the control, read left to right respectively, populate the four parameters. In the second prototype above, `dwAddress` is populated as follows.  
  
|Field|Bits containing the field value|  
|-----------|-------------------------------------|  
|0|24 through 31|  
|1|16 through 23|  
|2|8 through 15|  
|3|0 through 7|
