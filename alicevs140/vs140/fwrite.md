# fwrite
Writes data to a stream.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_t fwrite(  
   const void *buffer,  
   size_t size,  
   size_t count,  
   FILE *stream   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `buffer`  
 Pointer to data to be written.  
  
 `size`  
 Item size, in bytes.  
  
 `count`  
 Maximum number of items to be written.  
  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to `FILE` structure.  
  
## Return Value  
 `fwrite` returns the number of full items actually written, which may be less than `count` if an error occurs. Also, if an error occurs, the file-position indicator cannot be determined. If either `stream` or `buffer` is a null pointer, or if an odd number of bytes to be written is specified in Unicode mode, the function invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../vs140/Parameter-Validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `fwrite` function writes up to `count` items, of `size` length each, from `buffer` to the output `stream`. The file pointer associated with `stream` (if there is one) is incremented by the number of bytes actually written. If `stream` is opened in text mode, each linefeed is replaced with a carriage-return – linefeed pair. The replacement has no effect on the return value.  
  
 When `stream` is opened in Unicode translation mode—for example, if `stream` is opened by calling `fopen` and using a mode parameter that includes `ccs=UNICODE`, `ccs=UTF-16LE`, or `ccs=UTF-8`, or if the mode is changed to a Unicode translation mode by using `_setmode` and a mode parameter that includes `_O_WTEXT`, `_O_U16TEXT`, or `_O_U8TEXT`—`buffer` is interpreted as a pointer to an array of `wchar_t` that contains UTF-16 data. An attempt to write an odd number of bytes in this mode causes a parameter validation error.  
  
 Because this function locks the calling thread, it is thread-safe. For a non-locking version, see `_fwrite_nolock`.
