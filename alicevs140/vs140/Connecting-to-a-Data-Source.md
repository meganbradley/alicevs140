# Connecting to a Data Source
An ODBC data source is a specific set of data, the information required to access that data, and the location of the data source, which can be described using a data-source name. From your program's point of view, the data source includes the data, the DBMS, the network (if any), and ODBC.  
  
 To access data provided by a data source, your program must first establish a connection to the data source. All data access is managed through that connection.  
  
 Data-source connections are encapsulated by class [CDatabase](../vs140/CDatabase-Class.md). When a `CDatabase` object is connected to a data source, you can:  
  
-   Construct [recordsets](../vs140/CRecordset-Class.md), which select records from tables or queries.  
  
-   Manage [transactions](../vs140/Transaction--ODBC-.md), batching updates so all are committed to the data source at once (or the whole transaction is rolled back so the data source is unchanged) â€” if the data source supports the required level of transactions.  
  
-   Directly execute [SQL](../vs140/SQL.md) statements.  
  
 When you finish working with a data-source connection, you close the `CDatabase` object and either destroy it or reuse it for a new connection. For more information about data-source connections, see [Data Source (ODBC)](../vs140/Data-Source--ODBC-.md).
