# AfxOleInit
Initializes OLE support for the application.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
BOOL AFXAPI AfxOleInit( );  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; 0 if initialization fails, possibly because incorrect versions of the OLE system DLLs are installed.  
  
## Remarks  
 Call this function to initialize the OLE support for an MFC application. When this function is called, the following actions occur:  
  
-   Initializes the COM library on the current apartment of the calling application. For more information, see [OleInitialize](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms690134).  
  
-   Creates a message filter object, implementing the [IMessageFilter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms693740) interface. This message filter can be accessed with a call to [AfxOleGetMessageFilter](../vs140/AfxOleGetMessageFilter.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If **AfxOleInit** is called from an MFC DLL, the call will fail. The failure occurs because the function assumes that, if it is called from a DLL, the OLE system was previously initialized by the calling application.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  MFC applications must be initialized as single threaded apartment (STA). If you call [CoInitializeEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms695279) in your `InitInstance` override, specify `COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED` (rather than `COINIT_MULTITHREADED`). For more information, see PRB: MFC Application Stops Responding When You Initialize the Application as a Multithreaded Apartment (828643) at [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;828643](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;828643).
