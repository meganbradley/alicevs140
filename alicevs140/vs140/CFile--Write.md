# CFile::Write
Writes data from a buffer to the file associated with the `CFile` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual void Write(  
   const void* lpBuf,  
   UINT nCount   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpBuf`  
 A pointer to the user-supplied buffer that contains the data to be written to the file.  
  
 `nCount`  
 The number of bytes to be transferred from the buffer. For text-mode files, carriage returnâ€“linefeed pairs are counted as single characters.  
  
## Remarks  
 **Write** throws an exception in response to several conditions, including the disk-full condition.  
  
## Example  
 [!CODE [NVC_MFCFiles#16](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_MFCFiles#16)]  
  
 In addition, see the examples for [CFile::CFile](../vs140/CFile--CFile.md) and [CFile::Open](../vs140/CFile--Open.md).  
  
## Requirements
