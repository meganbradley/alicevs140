# ATL-MFC Shared Classes
Beginning with Visual C++ .NET 2002, several existing MFC utility classes were rewritten or revised to reduce their dependencies on other MFC classes. These utility classes can now be used in any native C++ project. This section only includes classes that were previously available to MFC projects and have now been shared, plus a few new classes related to the changes in `CString`. It does not include the ATL classes, which can be used in any native C++ project type by inclusion of the appropriate header.
