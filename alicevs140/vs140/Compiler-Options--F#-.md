# Compiler Options (F#)
This topic describes compiler command-line options for the F# compiler, fsc.exe. The compilation environment can also be controlled by setting the project properties.  
  
## Compiler Options Listed Alphabetically  
 The following table shows compiler options listed alphabetically. Some of the F# compiler options are similar to the C# compiler options. If that is the case, a link to the C# compiler options topic is provided.  
  
|Compiler Option|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`-a` `<output-filename>`|Generates a library and specifies its filename. This option is a short form of `--target:library``<filename>`.|  
|`--baseaddress:<string>`|Specifies the base address of the library to be built.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/baseaddress (C# Compiler Option)](../Topic/-baseaddress%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).|  
|`--codepage:<int>`|Specifies the codepage used to read source files.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/codepage (C# Compiler Options)](../vs140/-codepage--C#-Compiler-Options-.md).|  
|`--consolecolors`|Specifies that errors and warnings use color-coded text on the console.|  
|`--crossoptimize`[`+`&#124;`-`]|Enables or disables cross-module optimizations.|  
|`--delaysign`[`+`&#124;`-`]|Delay-signs the assembly using only the public portion of the strong name key.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/delaysign (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-delaysign%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).|

The default is full, which allows attaching to a running program. Choose `pdbonly` to get limited debugging information stored in a pdb (program database) file.<br /><br /> Equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see<br /><br /> [/debug (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-debug%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).|

|`--nowin32manifest`|Instructs the compiler to omit the default Win32 manifest.|  
|`--nowarn:<int-list>`|Disables specific warnings listed by number. Separate each warning number by a comma. You can discover the warning number for any warning from the compilation output.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name.

This option only applies when `--debug` is also enabled.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/pdb (C# Compiler Options)](../vs140/-pdb--C#-Compiler-Options-.md).|  
|`--platform:<platform-name>`|Specifies that the generated code will only run on the specified platform (`x86`, `Itanium`, or `x64`), or, if the platform-name `anycpu` is chosen, specifies that the generated code can run on any platform.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/platform (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-platform%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).|

|`--simpleresolution`|Specifies that assembly references should be resolved using directory-based Mono rules rather than MSBuild resolution. The default is to use MSBuild resolution except when running under Mono.|  
|`--standalone`|Specifies to produce an assembly that contains all of its dependencies so that it runs by itself without the need for additional assemblies, such as the F# library.|  
|`--staticlink:<assembly-name`>|Statically links the given assembly and all referenced DLLs that depend on this assembly. Use the assembly name, not the DLL name.|

Use 6.02 for [!INCLUDE[win8](../vs140/includes/win8_md.md)], 6.01 for Windows 7, 6.00 for Windows Vista. This option only applies to executables, not DLLs, and need only be used if your application depends on specific security features available only on certain versions of the OS. If this option is used, and a user attempts to execute your application on a lower version of the OS, it will fail with an error message.|  
|`--tailcalls`[`+`&#124;`-`]|Enables or disables the use of the tail IL instruction, which causes the stack frame to be reused for tail recursive functions. This option is enabled by default.|

|`--times`|Displays timing information for compilation.|  
|`--utf8output`|Enables printing compiler output in the UTF-8 encoding.|  
|`--warn:<warning-level>`|Sets a warning level (0 to 5). The default level is 3. Each warning is given a level based on its severity. Level 5 gives more, but less severe, warnings than level 1.<br /><br /> Level 5 warnings are: 21 (recursive use checked at runtime), 22 (`let rec` evaluated out of order), 45 (full abstraction), and 52 (defensive copy). All other warnings are level 2.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/warn (C# Compiler Options)](../vs140/-warn--C#-Compiler-Options-.md).|  
|`--warnon:<int-list>`|Enable specific warnings that might be off by default or disabled by another command line option. In F# 3.0, only the 1182 (unused variables) warning is off by default.|  
|`--warnaserror`[`+`&#124;`-`] [`<int-list>`]|Enables or disables the option to report warnings as errors. You can provide specific warning numbers to be disabled or enabled. Options later in the command line override options earlier in the command line. For example, to specify the warnings that you don't want reported as errors, specify `--warnaserror+ --warnaserror-:<int-list>`.<br /><br /> This compiler option is equivalent to the C# compiler option of the same name. For more information, see [/warnaserror (C# Compiler Options)](../Topic/-warnaserror%20\(C%23%20Compiler%20Options\).md).|
