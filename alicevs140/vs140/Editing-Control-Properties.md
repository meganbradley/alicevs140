# Editing Control Properties
### To edit the properties of a control or controls  
  
1.  In the dialog box, select the control you want to modify.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you select multiple controls, only the properties common to the selected controls can be edited.  
  
2.  In the [Properties window](../vs140/Properties-Window.md), change the properties of your control.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When you set the **Bitmap** property for a button, radio button, or check box control equal to **True**, the style BS_BITMAP is implemented for your control. For more information, see [Button Styles](../vs140/Button-Styles.md). For an example of associating a bitmap with a control, see [CButton::SetBitmap](../vs140/CButton--SetBitmap.md). Bitmaps will not appear on your control while you are in the Dialog resource editor.  
  
### To undo changes to the properties of a control  
  
1.  Make sure the control has focus in the Dialog editor.  
  
2.  Choose **Undo** from the **Edit** menu (if focus is not on the control, the **Undo** command will be unavailable).
