# CDaoDatabase::GetName
Call this member function to retrieve the name of the currently open database, which is the name of an existing database file or the name of a registered ODBC data source.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CString GetName( );  
  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 The full path and file name of the database if successful; otherwise, an empty [CString](../vs140/CStringT-Class.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 If your network supports the uniform naming convention (UNC), you can also specify a network pathâ€”for example, "\\\\\\\MYSERVER\\\MYSHARE\\\MYDIR\\\MYDB.MDB". (Double backslashes are required in string literals because "\\" is the C++ escape character.)  
  
 You might, for example, want to display this name in a heading. If an error occurs while the name is being retrieved, MFC throws an exception of type [CDaoException](../vs140/CDaoException-Class.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For better performance when external databases are being accessed, we recommend that you attach external database tables to a Microsoft Jet database (.MDB) rather than connecting directly to the data source.  
  
 The database type is indicated by the file or directory that the path points to, as follows:  
  
|Pathname points to..|Database type|  
|--------------------------|-------------------|  
|.MDB file|Microsoft Jet database (Microsoft Access)|  
|Directory that contains .DBF file(s)|dBASE database|  
|Directory that contains .XLS file|Microsoft Excel database|  
|Directory that contains .PDX file(s)|Paradox database|  
|Directory that contains appropriately formatted text database files|Text format database|  
  
 For ODBC databases such as SQL Server and Oracle, the database's connection string identifies a data source name (DSN) that's registered by ODBC.
