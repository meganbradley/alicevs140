# ISource Class
The             `ISource` class is the interface for all source blocks. Source blocks propagate messages to             `ITarget` blocks.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<  
   class             _Type  
>  
class ISource;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Type`  
 The data type of the payload within the messages produced by the source block.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Typedefs

|`source_type`|A type alias for                                         `_Type`.|

## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `ISource`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="isource__accept_method"></a>  ISource::accept Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, accepts a message that was offered by this                 `ISource` block, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * accept(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the offered                                 `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the                                 `accept` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the message that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 The                         `accept` method is called by a target while a message is being offered by this                         `ISource` block. The message pointer returned may be different from the one passed into the                         `propagate` method of the                         `ITarget` block, if this source decides to make a copy of the message.  
  
##  <a name="isource__acquire_ref_method"></a>  ISource::acquire_ref Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, acquires a reference count on this                 `ISource` block, to prevent deletion.  
  
```  
virtual void acquire_ref(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an                         `ITarget` object that is being linked to this source during the                         `link_target` method.  
  
##  <a name="isource__consume_method"></a>  ISource::consume Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, consumes a message previously offered by this                 `ISource` block and successfully reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * consume(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the reserved                                 `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the                                 `consume` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the                         `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 The                         `consume` method is similar to                         `accept`, but must always be preceded by a call to                         `reserve` that returned                         `true`.  
  
##  <a name="isource___dtorisource_destructor"></a>  ISource::~ISource Destructor  
 Destroys the                 `ISource` object.  
  
```  
virtual ~ISource();  
```  
  
##  <a name="isource__link_target_method"></a>  ISource::link_target Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, links a target block to this                 `ISource` block.  
  
```  
virtual void link_target(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block being linked to this                                 `ISource` block.  
  
##  <a name="isource__release_method"></a>  ISource::release Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, releases a previous successful message reservation.  
  
```  
virtual void release(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the reserved                                 `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the                                 `release` method.  
  
##  <a name="isource__release_ref_method"></a>  ISource::release_ref Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, releases a reference count on this                 `ISource` block.  
  
```  
virtual void release_ref(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an                         `ITarget` object that is being unlinked from this source. The source block is allowed to release any resources reserved for the target block.  
  
##  <a name="isource__reserve_method"></a>  ISource::reserve Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, reserves a message previously offered by this                 `ISource` block.  
  
```  
virtual bool reserve(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the offered                                 `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the                                 `reserve` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved,                         `false` otherwise. Reservations can fail for many reasons, including: the message was already reserved or accepted by another target, the source could deny reservations, and so forth.  
  
### Remarks  
 After you call                         `reserve`, if it succeeds, you must call either                         `consume` or                         `release` in order to take or give up possession of the message, respectively.  
  
##  <a name="isource__unlink_target_method"></a>  ISource::unlink_target Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, unlinks a target block from this                 `ISource` block, if found to be previously linked.  
  
```  
virtual void unlink_target(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block being unlinked from this                                 `ISource` block.  
  
##  <a name="isource__unlink_targets_method"></a>  ISource::unlink_targets Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, unlinks all target blocks from this                 `ISource` block.  
  
```  
virtual void unlink_targets() = 0;  
```
