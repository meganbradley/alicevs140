# inplace_merge
Combines the elements from two consecutive sorted ranges into a single sorted range, where the ordering criterion may be specified by a binary predicate.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<class BidirectionalIterator>  
   void inplace_merge(  
      BidirectionalIterator _First,   
      BidirectionalIterator _Middle,  
      BidirectionalIterator _Last  
   );  
template<class BidirectionalIterator, class Predicate>  
   void inplace_merge(  
      BidirectionalIterator _First,   
      BidirectionalIterator _Middle,  
      BidirectionalIterator _Last,  
      Predicate _Comp  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_First`  
 A bidirectional iterator addressing the position of the first element in the first of two consecutive sorted ranges to be combined and sorted into a single range.  
  
 `_Middle`  
 A bidirectional iterator addressing the position of the first element in the second of two consecutive sorted ranges to be combined and sorted into a single range.  
  
 `_Last`  
 A bidirectional iterator addressing the position one past the last element in the second of two consecutive sorted ranges to be combined and sorted into a single range.  
  
 `_Comp`  
 User-defined predicate function object that defines the sense in which one element is greater than another. The binary predicate takes two arguments and should return **true** when the first element is less than the second element and **false** otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 The sorted consecutive ranges referenced must be valid; all pointers must be dereferenceable and, within each sequence, the last position must be reachable from the first by incrementation.  
  
 The sorted consecutive ranges must each be arranged as a precondition to the application of the `inplace_merge` algorithm in accordance with the same ordering as is to be used by the algorithm to sort the combined ranges. The operation is stable as the relative order of elements within each range is preserved. When there are equivalent elements in both source ranges, the element is the first range precedes the element from the second in the combined range.  
  
 The complexity depends on the available memory as the algorithm allocates memory to a temporary buffer. If sufficient memory is available, the best case is linear with (*_Last – _First*) – 1 comparisons; if no auxiliary memory is available, the worst case is *N* log*(N)*, where *N* = (*_Last – _First*).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// alg_inplace_merge.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <vector>  
#include <algorithm>  
#include <functional>      //For greater<int>( )  
#include <iostream>  
  
// Return whether modulus of elem1 is less than modulus of elem2  
bool mod_lesser ( int elem1, int elem2 )  
{  
   if ( elem1 < 0 )   
      elem1 = - elem1;  
   if ( elem2 < 0 )   
      elem2 = - elem2;  
   return elem1 < elem2;  
}
