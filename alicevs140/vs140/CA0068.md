# CA0068
Debug information (symbols) could not be found for target assembly *'AssemblyName'*. For best analysis results, include the .pdb file with debug information for *'AssemblyName'* in the same directory as the target assembly.  
  
 The debug information found in .pdb files improves the accuracy of some Code Analysis checks. A missing .pdb file can lead to increased false positives, also known as noise, or to bad analysis. To enable .pdb generation, open the project properties page. On the **Build** tab, find the **Debug Info** list. The location varies by project type. Make sure that **Debug info** is either set to **full** for debug builds or to  **pdb-only** for release builds. It should not be set to **none**.
