# Conversions from Other Types
Since an `enum` value is an `int` value by definition, conversions to and from an `enum` value are the same as those for the `int` type. For the Microsoft C compiler, an integer is the same as a **long**.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 No conversions between structure or union types are allowed.  
  
 Any value can be converted to type `void`, but the result of such a conversion can be used only in a context where an expression value is discarded, such as in an expression statement.  
  
 The `void` type has no value, by definition. Therefore, it cannot be converted to any other type, and other types cannot be converted to `void` by assignment. However, you can explicitly cast a value to type `void`, as discussed in [Type-Cast Conversions](../vs140/Type-Cast-Conversions.md).
