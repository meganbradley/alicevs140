# CDataExchange Class
Supports the dialog data exchange (DDX) and dialog data validation (DDV) routines used by the Microsoft Foundation classes.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CDataExchange  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDataExchange::CDataExchange](#cdataexchange__cdataexchange)|Constructs a `CDataExchange` object.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDataExchange::Fail](#cdataexchange__fail)|Called when validation fails. Resets focus to the previous control and throws an exception.|

### Public Data Members  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDataExchange::m_bSaveAndValidate](#cdataexchange__m_bsaveandvalidate)|Flag for the direction of DDX and DDV.|  
|[CDataExchange::m_pDlgWnd](#cdataexchange__m_pdlgwnd)|The dialog box or window where the data exchange takes place.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `CDataExchange` does not have a base class.  
  
 Use this class if you are writing data exchange routines for custom data types or controls, or if you are writing your own data validation routines. For more information on writing your own DDX and DDV routines, see [Technical Note 26](../vs140/TN026--DDX-and-DDV-Routines.md). For an overview of DDX and DDV, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../vs140/Dialog-Data-Exchange-and-Validation.md) and [Dialog Boxes](../vs140/Dialog-Boxes.md).  
  
 A `CDataExchange` object provides the context information needed for DDX and DDV to take place. The flag `m_bSaveAndValidate` is **FALSE** when DDX is used to fill the initial values of dialog controls from data members. The flag `m_bSaveAndValidate` is **TRUE** when DDX is used to set the current values of dialog controls into data members and when DDV is used to validate the data values. If the DDV validation fails, the DDV procedure will display a message box explaining the input error. The DDV procedure will then call **Fail** to reset the focus to the offending control and throw an exception to stop the validation process.  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `CDataExchange`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwin.h  
  
##  <a name="cdataexchange__cdataexchange"></a>  CDataExchange::CDataExchange  
 Call this member function to construct a `CDataExchange` object.  
  
```  
CDataExchange(    CWnd*  pDlgWnd ,    BOOL  bSaveAndValidate );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pDlgWnd*  
 A pointer to the parent window that contains the control. Usually this is a [CDialog](../vs140/CDialog-Class.md)-derived object.  
  
 `bSaveAndValidate`  
 If **TRUE**, this object validates data, then writes data from the controls to the members. If **FALSE**, this object will move data from members to controls.  
  
### Remarks  
 Construct a `CDataExchange` object yourself to store extra information in the data exchange object to pass to your window's [CWnd::DoDataExchange](../vs140/CWnd-Class.md#cwnd__dodataexchange) member function.  
  
### Example  
  [!CODE [NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#70](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#70)]  
  
##  <a name="cdataexchange__fail"></a>  CDataExchange::Fail  
 The framework calls this member function when a dialog data validation (DDV) operation fails.  
  
```  
void Fail( );  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 **Fail** restores the focus and selection to the control whose validation failed (if there is a control to restore). **Fail** then throws an exception of type [CUserException](../vs140/CUserException-Class.md) to stop the validation process. The exception causes a message box explaining the error to be displayed. After DDV validation fails, the user can reenter data in the offending control.  
  
 Implementors of custom DDV routines can call **Fail** from their routines when a validation fails.  
  
 For more information on writing your own DDX and DDV routines, see [Technical Note 26](../vs140/TN026--DDX-and-DDV-Routines.md). For an overview of DDX and DDV, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../vs140/Dialog-Data-Exchange-and-Validation.md) and [Dialog Box Topics](../vs140/Dialog-Boxes.md).  
  
##  <a name="cdataexchange__m_bsaveandvalidate"></a>  CDataExchange::m_bSaveAndValidate  
 This flag indicates the direction of a dialog data exchange (DDX) operation.  
  
```  
BOOL m_bSaveAndValidate;  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The flag is nonzero if the `CDataExchange` object is being used to move data from the dialog controls to dialog-class data members after the user edits the controls. The flag is zero if the object is being used to initialize dialog controls from dialog-class data members.  
  
 The flag is also nonzero during dialog data validation (DDV).  
  
 For more information on writing your own DDX and DDV routines, see [Technical Note 26](../vs140/TN026--DDX-and-DDV-Routines.md). For an overview of DDX and DDV, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../vs140/Dialog-Data-Exchange-and-Validation.md) and [Dialog Box Topics](../vs140/Dialog-Boxes.md).  
  
##  <a name="cdataexchange__m_pdlgwnd"></a>  CDataExchange::m_pDlgWnd  
 Contains a pointer to the [CWnd](../vs140/CWnd-Class.md) object for which dialog data exchange (DDX) or validation (DDV) is taking place.  
  
```  
CWnd* m_pDlgWnd;  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 This object is usually a [CDialog](../vs140/CDialog-Class.md) object. Implementors of custom DDX or DDV routines can use this pointer to obtain access to the dialog window that contains the controls they are operating on.

For an overview of DDX and DDV, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../vs140/Dialog-Data-Exchange-and-Validation.md) and [Dialog Box Topics](../vs140/Dialog-Boxes.md).  
  
##  <a name="cdataexchange__preparectrl"></a>  CDataExchange::PrepareCtrl  
 The framework calls this member function to prepare the specified control for dialog data exchange (DDX) and validation (DDV).  
  
```  
HWND PrepareCtrl(    int nIDC  );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nIDC`  
 The ID of the control to be prepared for DDX or DDV.  
  
### Return Value  
 The `HWND` of the control being prepared for DDX or DDV.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use [PrepareEditCtrl](#cdataexchange__prepareeditctrl) instead for edit controls; use this member function for all other controls.  
  
 Preparation consists of storing the control's `HWND` in the `CDataExchange` class. The framework uses this handle to restore the focus to the previously focused control in the event of a DDX or DDV failure.  
  
 Implementors of custom DDX or DDV routines should call `PrepareCtrl` for all non-edit controls for which they are exchanging data via DDX or validating data via DDV.  
  
 For more information on writing your own DDX and DDV routines, see [Technical Note 26](../vs140/TN026--DDX-and-DDV-Routines.md). For an overview of DDX and DDV, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../vs140/Dialog-Data-Exchange-and-Validation.md) and [Dialog Box Topics](../vs140/Dialog-Boxes.md).  
  
##  <a name="cdataexchange__prepareeditctrl"></a>  CDataExchange::PrepareEditCtrl  
 The framework calls this member function to prepare the specified edit control for dialog data exchange (DDX) and validation (DDV).  
  
```  
HWND PrepareEditCtrl(    int nIDC  );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nIDC`  
 The ID of the edit control to be prepared for DDX or DDV.  
  
### Return Value  
 The `HWND` of the edit control being prepared for DDX or DDV.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use [PrepareCtrl](#cdataexchange__preparectrl) instead for all non-edit controls.  
  
 Preparation consists of two things. First, `PrepareEditCtrl` stores the control's `HWND` in the `CDataExchange` class. The framework uses this handle to restore the focus to the previously focused control in the event of a DDX or DDV failure. Second, `PrepareEditCtrl` sets a flag in the `CDataExchange` class to indicate that the control whose data is being exchanged or validated is an edit control.  
  
 Implementors of custom DDX or DDV routines should call `PrepareEditCtrl` for all edit controls for which they are exchanging data via DDX or validating data via DDV.  
  
 For more information on writing your own DDX and DDV routines, see [Technical Note 26](../vs140/TN026--DDX-and-DDV-Routines.md). For an overview of DDX and DDV, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../vs140/Dialog-Data-Exchange-and-Validation.md) and [Dialog Box Topics](../vs140/Dialog-Boxes.md).  
  
##  <a name="cdataexchange__prepareolectrl"></a>  CDataExchange::PrepareOleCtrl  
 The framework calls this member function to prepare the specified OLE control for dialog data exchange (DDX) and validation (DDV).  
  
```  
COleControlSite* PrepareOleCtrl(    int  nIDC );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `nIDC`  
 The ID of the OLE control to be prepared for DDX or DDV.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the OLE control site.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use [PrepareEditCtrl](#cdataexchange__prepareeditctrl) instead for edit controls or [PrepareCtrl](#cdataexchange__preparectrl) for all other non-OLE controls.  
  
 Implementors of custom DDX or DDV routines should call `PrepareOleCtrl` for all OLE controls for which they are exchanging data via DDX or validating data via DDV.  
  
 For more information on writing your own DDX and DDV routines, see [Technical Note 26](../vs140/TN026--DDX-and-DDV-Routines.md).
