# &lt;ios&gt;
Defines several types and functions basic to the operation of iostreams. This header is typically included for you by another iostream headers; you rarely include it directly.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#include <ios>  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 A large group of functions are manipulators. A manipulator declared in <ios\> alters the values stored in its argument object of class [ios_base](../vs140/ios_base-Class.md). Other manipulators perform actions on streams controlled by objects of a type derived from this class, such as a specialization of one of the template classes [basic_istream](../vs140/basic_istream-Class.md) or [basic_ostream](../vs140/basic_ostream-Class.md). For example, [noskipws](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#noskipws)(**str**) clears the format flag `ios_base::skipws` in the object **str**, which can be of one of these types.  
  
 You can also call a manipulator by inserting it into an output stream or extracting it from an input stream, because of special insertion and extraction operations supplied for the classes derived from `ios_base`. For example:  
  
```  
istr >> noskipws;  
```  
  
 calls [noskipws](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#noskipws)(**istr**).  
  
### Typedefs  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[ios](../vs140/-ios--typedefs.md#ios)|Supports the ios class from the old iostream library.|  
|[streamoff](../vs140/-ios--typedefs.md#streamoff)|Supports internal operations.|  
|[streampos](../vs140/-ios--typedefs.md#streampos)|Holds the current position of the buffer pointer or file pointer.|  
|[streamsize](../vs140/-ios--typedefs.md#streamsize)|Specifies the size of the stream.|  
|[wios](../vs140/-ios--typedefs.md#wios)|Supports the wios class from the old iostream library.|  
|[wstreampos](../vs140/-ios--typedefs.md#wstreampos)|Holds the current position of the buffer pointer or file pointer.|  
  
### Manipulators  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[boolalpha](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#boolalpha)|Specifies that variables of type [bool](../vs140/bool--C---.md) appear as **true** or **false** in the stream.|  
|[dec](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#dec)|Specifies that integer variables appear in base 10 notation.|  
|[defaultfloat](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#ios_defaultfloat)|Configures the flags of an `ios_base` object to use a default display format for float values.|  
|[fixed](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#fixed)|Specifies that a floating-point number is displayed in fixed-decimal notation.|  
|[hex](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#hex)|Specifies that integer variables appear in base 16 notation.|  
|[internal](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#internal)|Causes a number's sign to be left justified and the number to be right justified.|  
|[left](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#left)|Causes text that is not as wide as the output width to appear in the stream flush with the left margin.|  
|[noboolalpha](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#noboolalpha)|Specifies that variables of type [bool](../vs140/bool--C---.md) appear as 1 or 0 in the stream.|  
|[noshowbase](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#noshowbase)|Turns off indicating the notational base in which a number is displayed.|  
|[noshowpoint](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#noshowpoint)|Displays only the whole-number part of floating-point numbers whose fractional part is zero.|  
|[noshowpos](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#noshowpos)|Causes positive numbers to not be explicitly signed.|  
|[noskipws](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#noskipws)|Cause spaces to be read by the input stream.|  
|[nounitbuf](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#nounitbuf)|Causes output to be buffered and processed when the buffer is full.|  
|[nouppercase](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#nouppercase)|Specifies that hexadecimal digits and the exponent in scientific notation appear in lowercase.|  
|[oct](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#oct)|Specifies that integer variables appear in base 8 notation.|  
|[right](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#right)|Causes text that is not as wide as the output width to appear in the stream flush with the right margin.|  
|[scientific](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#scientific)|Causes floating point numbers to be displayed using scientific notation.|  
|[showbase](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#showbase)|Indicates the notational base in which a number is displayed.|  
|[showpoint](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#showpoint)|Displays the whole-number part of a floating-point number and digits to the right of the decimal point even when the fractional part is zero.|  
|[showpos](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#showpos)|Causes positive numbers to be explicitly signed.|  
|[skipws](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#skipws)|Cause spaces to not be read by the input stream.|  
|[unitbuf](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#unitbuf)|Causes output to be processed when the buffer is not empty.|  
|[uppercase](../vs140/-ios--functions.md#uppercase)|Specifies that hexadecimal digits and the exponent in scientific notation appear in uppercase.|  
  
### Classes  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[basic_ios](../vs140/basic_ios-Class.md)|The template class describes the storage and member functions common to both input streams (of template class [basic_istream](../vs140/basic_istream-Class.md)) and output streams (of template class [basic_ostream](../vs140/basic_ostream-Class.md)) that depend on the template parameters.|  
|[fpos](../vs140/fpos-Class.md)|The template class describes an object that can store all the information needed to restore an arbitrary file-position indicator within any stream.|  
|[ios_base](../vs140/ios_base-Class.md)|The class describes the storage and member functions common to both input and output streams that do not depend on the template parameters.|
