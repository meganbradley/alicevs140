# Writing User Commands and Actions
You can customize a domain-specific language by adding commands to the diagram, and by responding to gestures such as drag-and-drop, click, and double-click events.  
  
## User actions  
  
-   [How to Modify a Standard Menu Command](../vs140/How-to--Modify-a-Standard-Menu-Command-in-a-Domain-Specific-Language.md) – You can customize the behavior of commands such as copy and print.  
  
-   [How to Add a command to the shortcut menu](../Topic/How%20to:%20Add%20a%20Command%20to%20the%20Shortcut%20Menu.md) – Create your own commands that can update your model or external resources.  
  
-   [How to add a drag and drop handler](../Topic/How%20to:%20Add%20a%20Drag-and-Drop%20Handler.md) – Allow the user to move items from one diagram to another, including UML diagrams. You can store references to one model in another.  
  
-   [How to Intercept a Click](../vs140/How-to--Intercept-a-Click-on-a-Shape-or-Decorator.md) – Allow your user to click through from an item to another item that it references.  
  
-   [How to Program Copy and Paste](../vs140/How-to--Program-Copy-and-Paste-Behavior---redirect.md) – How to use ElementOperations.  
  
-   [How to access and constrain the current selection](../vs140/How-to--Access-and-Constrain-the-Current-Selection.md)  
  
-   [Customizing element tools](../vs140/Customizing-Element-Tools.md)
