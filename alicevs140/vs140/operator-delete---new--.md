# operator delete (&lt;new&gt;)
The function called by a delete expression to deallocate storage for individual of objects.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void operator delete(  
   void* _Ptr  
) throw( );  
void operator delete(  
   void *,   
   void *  
) throw( );  
void operator delete(  
   void* _Ptr,  
   const std::nothrow_t&  
) throw( );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Ptr`  
 The pointer whose value is to be rendered invalid by the deletion.  
  
## Remarks  
 The first function is called by a delete expression to render the value of `_Ptr` invalid. The program can define a function with this function signature that replaces the default version defined by the Standard C++ Library. The required behavior is to accept a value of `_Ptr` that is null or that was returned by an earlier call to [operator new](../vs140/operator-new---new--.md)(**size_t**).  
  
 The default behavior for a null value of `_Ptr` is to do nothing. Any other value of `_Ptr` must be a value returned earlier by a call as previously described. The default behavior for such a nonnull value of `_Ptr` is to reclaim storage allocated by the earlier call. It is unspecified under what conditions part or all of such reclaimed storage is allocated by a subsequent call to `operator new`(**size_t**), or to any of `calloc`(**size_t**), `malloc`(**size_t**), or `realloc`(**void\***, **size_t**).  
  
 The second function is called by a placement delete expression corresponding to a new expression of the form **new**(**std::size_t**). It does nothing.  
  
 The third function is called by a placement delete expression corresponding to a new expression of the form **new**(**std::size_t**, **const std::nothrow_t&**). The program can define a function with this function signature that replaces the default version defined by the Standard C++ Library. The required behavior is to accept a value of `_Ptr` that is null or that was returned by an earlier call to `operator new`(**size_t**). The default behavior is to evaluate **delete**(`_Ptr`).  
  
## Example  
 See [operator new](../vs140/operator-new---new--.md) for an example that use `operator delete`.
