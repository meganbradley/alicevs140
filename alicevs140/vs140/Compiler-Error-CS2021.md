# Compiler Error CS2021
File name 'file' is too long or invalid  
  
 All file names passed to the C# compiler must be no longer than `_MAX_PATH` (defined in a Windows header file). the compiler will give this error in the following situations:  
  
-   A file name (including the path) is longer than `_MAX_PATH`.  
  
-   The file name contains invalid characters.  
  
-   The file name contains wildcards where wildcards are not allowed (such as in resource file names).
