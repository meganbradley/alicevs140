# multitype_join Class
A             `multitype_join` messaging block is a multi-source, single-target messaging block that combines together messages of different types from each of its sources and offers a tuple of the combined messages to its targets.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<  
   typename             _Type,  
   join_type             _Jtype = non_greedy  
>  
class multitype_join: public ISource<typename _Unwrap<            _Type>::type>;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Type`  
 The                         `tuple` payload type of the messages joined and propagated by the block.  
  
 `_Jtype`  
 The kind of                         `join` block this is, either                         `greedy` or                         `non_greedy`

```  
virtual message<_Destination_type> * accept(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the offered                                 `message` object.

### Return Value  
 A pointer to the message that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__acquire_ref_method"></a>  multitype_join::acquire_ref Method  
 Acquires a reference count on this                 `multitype_join` messaging block, to prevent deletion.  
  
```  
virtual void acquire_ref(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an                         `ITarget` object that is being linked to this source during the                         `link_target` method.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__consume_method"></a>  multitype_join::consume Method  
 Consumes a message previously offered by the                 `multitype_join` messaging block and successfully reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Destination_type> * consume(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the reserved                                 `message` object.

### Remarks  
 The                         `consume` method is similar to                         `accept`, but must always be preceded by a call to                         `reserve` that returned                         `true`.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__link_target_method"></a>  multitype_join::link_target Method

```  
virtual void link_target(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to an                                 `ITarget` block to link to this                                 `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__multitype_join_constructor"></a>  multitype_join::multitype_join Constructor  
 Constructs a                 `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
explicit multitype_join(  
   _Type                 _Tuple  
);  
  
multitype_join(  
   Scheduler&                 _PScheduler,  
   _Type                 _Tuple  
);  
  
multitype_join(  
   ScheduleGroup&                 _PScheduleGroup,  
   _Type                 _Tuple  
);  
  
multitype_join(  
   multitype_join &&                 _Join  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Tuple`  
 A                                 `tuple` of sources for this                                 `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The                                 `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the                                 `multitype_join` messaging block is scheduled.  
  
 `_PScheduleGroup`  
 The                                 `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the                                 `multitype_join` messaging block is scheduled. The                                 `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
 `_Join`  
 A                                 `multitype_join` messaging block to copy from. Note that the original object is orphaned, making this a move constructor.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the                         `_PScheduler` or                         `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
 Move construction is not performed under a lock, which means that it is up to the user to make sure that there are no light-weight tasks in flight at the time of moving. Otherwise, numerous races can occur, leading to exceptions or inconsistent state.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join___dtormultitype_join_destructor"></a>  multitype_join::~multitype_join Destructor  
 Destroys the                 `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
~multitype_join();  
```  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__release_method"></a>  multitype_join::release Method  
 Releases a previous successful message reservation.  
  
```  
virtual void release(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the                                 `message` object being released.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the                                 `release` method.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__release_ref_method"></a>  multitype_join::release_ref Method  
 Releases a reference count on this                 `multiple_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void release_ref(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an                         `ITarget` object that is being unlinked from this source. The source block is allowed to release any resources reserved for the target block.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__reserve_method"></a>  multitype_join::reserve Method  
 Reserves a message previously offered by this                 `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual bool reserve(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the                                 `message` object being reserved.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the                                 `reserve` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved,                         `false` otherwise. Reservations can fail for many reasons, including: the message was already reserved or accepted by another target, the source could deny reservations, and so forth.  
  
### Remarks  
 After you call                         `reserve`, if it succeeds, you must call either                         `consume` or                         `release` in order to take or give up possession of the message, respectively.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__unlink_target_method"></a>  multitype_join::unlink_target Method  
 Unlinks a target block from this                 `multitype_join` messaging block.

   _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to an                                 `ITarget` block to unlink from this                                 `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
##  <a name="multitype_join__unlink_targets_method"></a>  multitype_join::unlink_targets Method  
 Unlinks all targets from this                 `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void unlink_targets();  
```
