# Compiler Error C3465
to use type 'type' you must reference the assembly 'assembly'  
  
 Type forwarding will work for a client application until you recompile the client. When you recompile, you will need a reference for every assembly containing the definition of a type used in your client application.  
  
 For more information, see [Type Forwarding](../vs140/Type-Forwarding--C---CLI-.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample builds an assembly that contains the new location of a type.  
  
```  
// C3465.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /LD  
public ref class R {  
public:  
   ref class N {};  
};  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following sample builds an assembly that used to contain the definition of the type, but now contains forwarding syntax for the type.  
  
```  
// C3465_b.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /LD  
#using "C3465.dll"  
[ assembly:TypeForwardedTo(R::typeid) ];  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C3465.  
  
```  
// C3465_c.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
// C3465 expected  
#using "C3465_b.dll"  
// Uncomment the following line to resolve.  
// #using "C3465.dll"  
  
int main() {  
   R^ r = gcnew R();  
}  
```
