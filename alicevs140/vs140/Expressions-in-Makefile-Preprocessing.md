# Expressions in Makefile Preprocessing
The **!IF** or **!ELSE IF** `constantexpression` consists of integer constants (in decimal or C-language notation), string constants, or commands. Use parentheses to group expressions. Expressions use C-style signed long integer arithmetic; numbers are in 32-bit two's-complement form in the range â€“ 2147483648 to 2147483647.  
  
 Expressions can use operators that act on constant values, exit codes from commands, strings, macros, and file-system paths.
