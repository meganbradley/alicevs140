# CWnd::OnNextMenu
The framework calls this member function when when the right or left arrow key is used to switch between the menu bar and the system menu.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnNextMenu(  
    UINT nKey,  
    LPMDINEXTMENU lpMdiNextMenu  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nKey`|A bitwise combination (OR) of flags that indicate which modifier keys are pressed. For example, the `MK_CONTROL` flag indicates that the CTRL key is pressed.<br /><br /> For a list of flags, see the "Message Parameters" subheading in [About Mouse Input](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645601).|

## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_UNINITMENUPOPUP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647614) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)]. In response to this message, your application can set the `hmenuNext` member of the [MDINEXTMENU](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647561) structure to specify the menu to switch to, and the `hwndNext` member to specify the window to receive menu notification messages.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
