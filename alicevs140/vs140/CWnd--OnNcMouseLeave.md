# CWnd::OnNcMouseLeave
The framework calls this member function when the cursor leaves the nonclient area of the window specified in a prior call to [TrackMouseEvent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646265).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnNcMouseLeave();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_NCMOUSELEAVE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645626) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
