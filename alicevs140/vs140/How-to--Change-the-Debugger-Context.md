# How to: Change the Debugger Context
The **Locals** window displays variables local to the current context or scope. To modify information in the **Locals** window, the debugger must be in break mode.  
  
 In run mode, information may appear in the **Locals** window, but the information will not be current until the next time your program breaks.  
  
### To change the context of the Locals window  
  
-   In break mode, use the **Debug Location** toolbar to select the desired function, thread, or process.  
  
     —or—  
  
-   Double-click a stack frame in the **Call Stack** window to change the context to that function call.  
  
     —or—  
  
-   Double-click a thread in the **Threads** window to change the context to that thread.  
  
     —or—  
  
-   Double-click a process in the **Processes** window to change the context to that process.
