# CWnd::RedrawWindow
Updates the specified rectangle or region in the given window's client area.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL RedrawWindow(  
   LPCRECT lpRectUpdate = NULL,  
   CRgn* prgnUpdate = NULL,  
   UINT flags = RDW_INVALIDATE | RDW_UPDATENOW | RDW_ERASE   
);   
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpRectUpdate`  
 Points to a [RECT](../vs140/RECT-Structure.md) structure containing the coordinates of the update rectangle. This parameter is ignored if *prgnUpdate* contains a valid region handle.  
  
 *prgnUpdate*  
 Identifies the update region. If both *prgnUpdate* and `lpRectUpdate` are **NULL**, the entire client area is added to the update region.  
  
 `flags`  
 The following flags are used to invalidate the window:  
  
-   **RDW_ERASE** Causes the window to receive a [WM_ERASEBKGND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms648055) message when the window is repainted. The **RDW_INVALIDATE** flag must also be specified; otherwise **RDW_ERASE** has no effect.  
  
-   **RDW_FRAME** Causes any part of the nonclient area of the window that intersects the update region to receive a [WM_NCPAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145212) message. The **RDW_INVALIDATE** flag must also be specified; otherwise **RDW_FRAME** has no effect.  
  
-   **RDW_INTERNALPAINT** Causes a [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message to be posted to the window regardless of whether the window contains an invalid region.  
  
-   **RDW_INVALIDATE** Invalidate `lpRectUpdate` or *prgnUpdate* (only one may be not **NULL**). If both are **NULL**, the entire window is invalidated.  
  
 The following flags are used to validate the window:  
  
-   **RDW_NOERASE** Suppresses any pending `WM_ERASEBKGND` messages.  
  
-   **RDW_NOFRAME** Suppresses any pending `WM_NCPAINT` messages. This flag must be used with **RDW_VALIDATE** and is typically used with **RDW_NOCHILDREN**. This option should be used with care, as it could prevent parts of a window from painting properly.  
  
-   **RDW_NOINTERNALPAINT** Suppresses any pending internal `WM_PAINT` messages. This flag does not affect `WM_PAINT` messages resulting from invalid areas.  
  
-   **RDW_VALIDATE** Validates `lpRectUpdate` or *prgnUpdate* (only one may be not **NULL**). If both are **NULL**, the entire window is validated. This flag does not affect internal `WM_PAINT` messages.  
  
 The following flags control when repainting occurs. Painting is not performed by the `RedrawWindow` function unless one of these bits is specified.  
  
-   **RDW_ERASENOW** Causes the affected windows (as specified by the **RDW_ALLCHILDREN** and **RDW_NOCHILDREN** flags) to receive `WM_NCPAINT` and `WM_ERASEBKGND` messages, if necessary, before the function returns. `WM_PAINT` messages are deferred.  
  
-   **RDW_UPDATENOW** Causes the affected windows (as specified by the **RDW_ALLCHILDREN** and **RDW_NOCHILDREN** flags) to receive `WM_NCPAINT`, `WM_ERASEBKGND`, and `WM_PAINT` messages, if necessary, before the function returns.  
  
 By default, the windows affected by the `RedrawWindow` function depend on whether the specified window has the **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** style. The child windows of **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** windows are not affected. However, those windows that are not **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** windows are recursively validated or invalidated until a **WS_CLIPCHILDREN** window is encountered. The following flags control which windows are affected by the `RedrawWindow` function:  
  
-   **RDW_ALLCHILDREN** Includes child windows, if any, in the repainting operation.  
  
-   **RDW_NOCHILDREN** Excludes child windows, if any, from the repainting operation.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if the window was redrawn successfully; otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the `RedrawWindow` member function is used to invalidate part of the desktop window, that window does not receive a [WM_PAINT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145213) message. To repaint the desktop, an application should use [CWnd::ValidateRgn](../vs140/CWnd--ValidateRgn.md), [CWnd::InvalidateRgn](../vs140/CWnd--InvalidateRgn.md), [CWnd::UpdateWindow](../vs140/CWnd--UpdateWindow.md), or [RedrawWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162911)
