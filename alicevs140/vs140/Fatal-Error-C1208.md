# Fatal Error C1208
Allocating reference classes on the stack is not supported by the version of the runtime installed  
  
 C1208 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.  
  
 Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.  
  
 Install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.
