# CRecordset::m_pDatabase
Contains a pointer to the `CDatabase` object through which the recordset is connected to a data source.  
  
## Remarks  
 This variable is set in two ways. Typically, you pass a pointer to an already connected `CDatabase` object when you construct the recordset object. If you pass **NULL** instead, `CRecordset` creates a `CDatabase` object for you and connects it. In either case, `CRecordset` stores the pointer in this variable.  
  
 Normally you will not directly need to use the pointer stored in **m_pDatabase**. If you write your own extensions to `CRecordset`, however, you might need to use the pointer. For example, you might need the pointer if you throw your own `CDBException`s. Or you might need it if you need to do something using the same `CDatabase` object, such as running transactions, setting timeouts, or calling the `ExecuteSQL` member function of class `CDatabase` to execute SQL statements directly.
