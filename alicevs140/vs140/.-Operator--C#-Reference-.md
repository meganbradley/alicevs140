# . Operator (C# Reference)
The dot operator (`.`) is used for member access. The dot operator specifies a member of a type or namespace. For example, the dot operator is used to access specific methods within the .NET Framework class libraries:  
  
 [!CODE [csRefOperators#16](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators#16)]  
  
 For example, consider the following class:  
  
 [!CODE [csRefOperators#17](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators#17)]  
  
 [!CODE [csRefOperators#18](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators#18)]  
  
 The variable `s` has two members, `a` and `b`; to access them, use the dot operator:  
  
 [!CODE [csRefOperators#19](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators#19)]  
  
 The dot is also used to form qualified names, which are names that specify the namespace or interface, for example, to which they belong.  
  
 [!CODE [csRefOperators#20](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators#20)]  
  
 The using directive makes some name qualification optional:  
  
 [!CODE [csRefOperators#21](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators#21)]  
  
 But when an identifier is ambiguous, it must be qualified:  
  
 [!CODE [csRefOperators#22](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators#22)]
