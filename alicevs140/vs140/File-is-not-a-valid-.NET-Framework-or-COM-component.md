# File is not a valid .NET Framework or COM component
You are attempting to view a file in the Object Browser that does not contain a valid object. Only [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] and COM components can be viewed in the Object Browser.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  If you selected the wrong file, select the correct file and try again.  
  
2.  If you mistakenly selected Object Browser in the **Open With** dialog box, choose a different program to open the file with.
