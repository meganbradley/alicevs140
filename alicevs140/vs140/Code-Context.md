# Code Context
In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugging, a **code context**:  
  
-   Provides an abstraction of a position in code as known to the debug engine (DE). For most run-time architectures today, a code context can be thought of as an address in a program's instruction stream. For nontraditional languages, where code may not be represented by instructions, a code context may be represented by some other means.  
  
-   Describes the current position in the execution stream of the program being debugged.  
  
-   Exists only when a program has stopped at a breakpoint.  
  
-   Has an associated document context.  
  
-   Is implemented by an [IDebugCodeContext2](../vs140/IDebugCodeContext2.md) interface.
