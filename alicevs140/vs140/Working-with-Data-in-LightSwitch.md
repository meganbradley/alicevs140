# Working with Data in LightSwitch
Applications that you build in LightSwitch use a "forms over data" model. This means that forms, which are called *screens* in LightSwitch, are used to display, enter, or update data that is stored in a database or other data source. In this set of lessons, youâ€™ll learn how to connect to a data source, change the data types that are used to display data, validate data, define relationships between data sources, and much more.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This lesson builds upon the My First Application project that you created in the [Creating Your First LightSwitch Application](../vs140/Creating-Your-First-LightSwitch-Application.md) lesson. If your application isn't already open in Visual Studio, on the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open Project** to open it.
