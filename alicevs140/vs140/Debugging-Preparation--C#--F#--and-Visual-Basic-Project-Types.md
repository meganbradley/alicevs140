# Debugging Preparation: C#, F#, and Visual Basic Project Types
The topics in this section describe how to debug the C#, F#, and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project types created by the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project templates.  
  
 Note that those project types that create DLLs as their output have been grouped into [Debugging DLL Projects](../vs140/Debugging-DLL-Projects.md) because of the common features they share.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Managed Debugging: Recommended Property Settings](../Topic/Managed%20Debugging:%20Recommended%20Property%20Settings.md)  
 This section describes the recommended debugging-related property settings for C#, F#, and Visual Basic projects.  
  
 [Debugging Preparation: Windows Forms Applications](../vs140/Debugging-Preparation--Windows-Forms-Applications.md)  
 Describes a Windows Application project and provides instructions for debugging, changing the default Debug configuration, and starting the application outside of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and attaching to it.  
  
 [Debugging Preparation: Console Projects](../vs140/Debugging-Preparation--Console-Projects.md)  
 Provides additional considerations for debugging C# or [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] console applications. This includes specifying command-line arguments, starting your application from the command prompt, writing to the Output window, and troubleshooting the Console window.  
  
 [Debugging Preparation: Windows Services](../vs140/Debugging-Preparation--Windows-Services.md)  
 Describes a Windows service and provides a link to Debugging Windows Service Applications.
