# transformer Class
A             `transformer` messaging block is a single-target, multi-source, ordered             `propagator_block` which can accept messages of one type and is capable of storing an unbounded number of messages of a different type.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<  
   class             _Input,  
   class             _Output  
>  
class transformer : public propagator_block<single_link_registry<ITarget<            _Output>>, multi_link_registry<ISource<            _Input>>>;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Input`  
 The payload type of the messages accepted by the buffer.  
  
 `_Output`  
 The payload type of the messages stored and propagated out by the buffer.

 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="transformer__accept_message_method"></a>  transformer::accept_message Method  
 Accepts a message that was offered by this                 `transformer` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Output> * accept_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```

### Return Value  
 A pointer to the                         `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
##  <a name="transformer__consume_message_method"></a>  transformer::consume_message Method  
 Consumes a message previously offered by the                 `transformer` and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.

### Remarks  
 Similar to                         `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to                         `reserve`.

 A pointer to the source block offering the message.  
  
### Return Value  
 A                         [message_status](concurrency_namespace_Enumerations) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  
  
##  <a name="transformer__propagate_to_any_targets_method"></a>  transformer::propagate_to_any_targets Method  
 Executes the transformer function on the input messages.  
  
```

```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the                                 `message` object being released.  
  
##  <a name="transformer__reserve_message_method"></a>  transformer::reserve_message Method  
 Reserves a message previously offered by this                 `transformer` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual bool reserve_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The                                 `runtime_object_identity` of the                                 `message` object being reserved.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved,                         `false` otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 After                         `reserve` is called, if it returns                         `true`, either                         `consume` or                         `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  
  
##  <a name="transformer__resume_propagation_method"></a>  transformer::resume_propagation Method  
 Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  
  
```  
virtual void resume_propagation();

##  <a name="transformer__send_message_method"></a>  transformer::send_message Method  
 Synchronously passes a message from an                 `ISource` block to this                 `transformer` messaging block. It is invoked by the                 `send` method, when called by a source block.  
  
```  
virtual message_status send_message(  
   _Inout_ message<_Input> *                 _PMessage,

```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to the                                 `message` object.  
  
 `_PSource`  
 A pointer to the source block offering the message.  
  
### Return Value  
 A                         [message_status](concurrency_namespace_Enumerations) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  
  
##  <a name="transformer__supports_anonymous_source_method"></a>  transformer::supports_anonymous_source Method  
 Overrides the                 `supports_anonymous_source` method to indicate that this block can accept messages offered to it by a source that is not linked.  
  
```  
virtual bool supports_anonymous_source();  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` because the block does not postpone offered messages.  
  
##  <a name="transformer__transformer_constructor"></a>  transformer::transformer Constructor

   _Inout_opt_ ITarget<_Output> *                 _PTarget = NULL  
);  
  
transformer(  
   _Transform_method const&                 _Func,  
   _Inout_opt_ ITarget<_Output> *                 _PTarget,

   _Inout_opt_ ITarget<_Output> *                 _PTarget,  
   filter_method const&                 _Filter  
);  
  
transformer(  
   ScheduleGroup&                 _PScheduleGroup,

   _Transform_method const&                 _Func,  
   _Inout_opt_ ITarget<_Output> *                 _PTarget,

### Parameters  
 `_Func`  
 A function that will be invoked for each accepted message.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to a target block to link with the transformer.  
  
 `_Filter`  
 A filter function which determines whether offered messages should be accepted.  
  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The                                 `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the                                 `transformer` messaging block is scheduled.  
  
 `_PScheduleGroup`  
 The                                 `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the                                 `transformer` messaging block is scheduled. The                                 `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the                         `_PScheduler` or                         `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
 The type                         `_Transform_method` is a functor with signature                         `_Output (_Input const &)` which is invoked by this                         `transformer` messaging block to process a message.  
  
 The type                         `filter_method` is a functor with signature                         `bool (_Input const &)` which is invoked by this                         `transformer` messaging block to determine whether or not it should accept an offered message.  
  
##  <a name="transformer___dtortransformer_destructor"></a>  transformer::~transformer Destructor

```  
~transformer();  
```
