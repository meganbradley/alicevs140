# setbuf
Controls stream buffering. This function is deprecated; use [setvbuf](../vs140/setvbuf.md) instead.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void setbuf(  
   FILE *stream,  
   char *buffer   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to `FILE` structure.  
  
 `buffer`  
 User-allocated buffer.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `setbuf` function controls buffering for `stream`. The `stream` argument must refer to an open file that has not been read or written. If the `buffer` argument is `NULL`, the stream is un-buffered. If not, the buffer must point to a character array of length `BUFSIZ`, where `BUFSIZ` is the buffer size as defined in STDIO.H. The user-specified buffer, instead of the default system-allocated buffer for the given stream, is used for I/O buffering. The `stderr` stream is un-buffered by default, but you can use `setbuf` to assign buffers to `stderr`.  
  
 `setbuf` has been replaced by [setvbuf](../vs140/setvbuf.md), which is the preferred routine for new code. `setbuf` is retained for compatibility with existing code.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`setbuf`|<stdio.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../vs140/Compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_setbuf.c  
// compile with: /W3  
// This program first opens files named DATA1 and  
// DATA2. Then it uses setbuf to give DATA1 a user-assigned  
// buffer and to change DATA2 so that it has no buffer.  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   char buf[BUFSIZ];  
   FILE *stream1, *stream2;  
  
   fopen_s( &stream1, "data1", "a" );  
   fopen_s( &stream2, "data2", "w" );  
  
   if( (stream1 != NULL) && (stream2 != NULL) )  
   {  
      // "stream1" uses user-assigned buffer:  
      setbuf( stream1, buf ); // C4996  
      // Note: setbuf is deprecated; consider using setvbuf instead  
      printf( "stream1 set to user-defined buffer at: %Fp\n", buf );  
  
      // "stream2" is unbuffered  
      setbuf( stream2, NULL ); // C4996  
      printf( "stream2 buffering disabled\n" );  
      _fcloseall();  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 **stream1 set to user-defined buffer at: 0012FCDC**  
**stream2 buffering disabled**
