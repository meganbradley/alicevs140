# XML Schema Designer
The XML Schema Designer (XSD Designer) is a graphical tool that allows you to visualize a schema set at different levels of abstraction. The following are the main components of the XSD Designer:  
  
-   [XML Schema Explorer](../vs140/XML-Schema-Explorer.md) enables you to browse and navigate the XML Schema tree and perform searches.  
  
-   The [Start View](../vs140/Start-View.md) is the launching point for the XSD Designer; from the Start View, you can navigate to other views of the XSD Designer and see the details of your schema set.  
  
-   The [Graph View](../vs140/Graph-View.md) enables you to see an overview of a schema set and the relationships between the schema nodes.  
  
-   The [Content Model View](../vs140/Content-Model-View.md) provides a graphical representation of the details of local and global schema nodes, including simple and complex types, elements, groups, attributes, and attribute groups.
