# CWinThread::IsIdleMessage
Override this function to keep **OnIdle** from being called after specific messages are generated.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual BOOL IsIdleMessage(  
   MSG* pMsg   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pMsg`  
 Points to the current message being processed.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if `OnIdle` should be called after processing message; otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The default implementation does not call **OnIdle** after redundant mouse messages and messages generated by blinking carets.  
  
 If an application has created a short timer, **OnIdle** will be called frequently, causing performance problems. To improve such an application's performance, override `IsIdleMessage` in the application's `CWinApp`-derived class to check for `WM_TIMER` messages as follows:  
  
 [!CODE [NVC_MFCDocView#189](../CodeSnippet/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_MFCDocView#189)]  
  
 Handling `WM_TIMER` in this fashion will improve performance of applications that use short timers.
