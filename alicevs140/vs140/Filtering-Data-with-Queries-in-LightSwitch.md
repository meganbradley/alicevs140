# Filtering Data with Queries in LightSwitch
In LightSwitch, you can use queries to work with a subset of data. For example, instead of displaying all orders, you can use a query to display orders for customers in a certain country or region.  
  
 In this set of lessons youâ€™ll learn how to create both simple and parameterized queries and apply them to screens.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These lessons build upon the My First Application project that you last modified in the [Displaying Local Information in a LightSwitch Application](../vs140/Displaying-Local-Information-in-a-LightSwitch-Application.md) lesson. If your application isn't already open in Visual Studio, on the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open Project** to open it.
