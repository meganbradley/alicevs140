# Printer error
An error occurred at the printer, but no other information was returned to the computer that sent the file.  
  
### To correct the error  
  
-   Physically examine the printer. Make sure all connections between the computer and the printer are solid. Most printers provide a display for error information such as "Offline" or "Out of paper."
