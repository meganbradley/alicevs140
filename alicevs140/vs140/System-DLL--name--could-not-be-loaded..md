# System DLL &lt;name&gt; could not be loaded.
A .dll file provided by the operating system, such as DDEML.DLL, VERSION.DLL, or WINSPOOL.DRV, couldn't be found. This error generally occurs if one of the following is true: the file is not on the proper path, the DLL has been corrupted or deleted, or there isn't enough memory.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check that the DLL is on the Windows system path.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Reload the DLL.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Try to free up memory by closing other open applications.
