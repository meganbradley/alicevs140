# Walkthrough: Creating a Standard C++ Program (C++)
You can use Visual C++ in the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) to create Standard C++ programs. By following the steps in this walkthrough, you can create a project, add a new file to the project, modify the file to add C++ code, and then compile and run the program by using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
 You can type your own C++ program or use one of the sample programs. The sample program in this walkthrough is a console application. This application uses the `set` container in the Standard Template Library (STL).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../vs140/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] complies with the 2003 C++ Standard, with these major exceptions: two-stage name lookup, exception specifications, and export. Additionally, [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../vs140/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] supports several C++0x features, for example, lambdas, auto, static_assert, rvalue references, and extern templates.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If compliance with the standard is required, use the **/Za** compiler option to disable Microsoft extensions to the standard. For more information, see [/Za, /Ze (Disable Language Extensions)](../Topic/-Za,%20-Ze%20\(Disable%20Language%20Extensions\).md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To complete this walkthrough, you must understand the fundamentals of the C++ language.  
  
### To create a project and add a source file  
  
1.  Create a project by pointing to **New** on the **File** menu, and then clicking **Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Visual C++** project types pane, click **Win32**, and then click **Win32 Console Application**.  
  
3.  Type a name for the project.  
  
     By default, the solution that contains the project has the same name as the project, but you can type a different name. You can also type a different location for the project.  
  
     Click **OK** to create the project.  
  
4.  In the **Win32 Application Wizard**, click **Next**, select **Empty Project**,and then click **Finish**.  
  
5.  If **Solution Explorer** is not displayed, on the **View** menu, click **Solution Explorer**.  
  
6.  Add a new source file to the project, as follows.  
  
    1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Source Files** folder, point to **Add**, and then click **New Item**.  
  
    2.  In the **Code** node, click **C++ File (.cpp)**, type a name for the file, and then click **Add**.  
  
     The .cpp file appears in the Source Files folder in **Solution Explorer**, and the file is opened in the Visual Studio editor.  
  
7.  In the file in the editor, type a valid C++ program that uses the Standard C++ Library, or copy one of the sample programs and paste it in the file.  
  
     For example, you can use the [set::find (STL Samples)](../vs140/set--find--STL-Samples-.md) sample program, which is one of the the Standard Template Library samples that are included in Help.  
  
     If you use the sample program, notice the `using namespace std;` directive. This directive enables the program to use `cout` and `endl` without requiring fully qualified names (`std::cout` and `std::endl`).  
  
8.  Save the file.  
  
9. On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  
  
     The **Output** window displays information about the compilation progress, for example, the location of the build log and a message that indicates the build status.  
  
10. On the **Debug** menu, click **Start without Debugging**.  
  
     If you used the sample program, a command window is displayed and shows whether certain integers are found in the set.
