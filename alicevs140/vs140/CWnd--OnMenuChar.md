# CWnd::OnMenuChar
The framework calls this member function when the user presses a menu mnemonic character that doesn't match any of the predefined mnemonics in the current menu.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg LRESULT OnMenuChar(  
   UINT nChar,  
   UINT nFlags,  
   CMenu* pMenu   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nChar`  
 Depending on the build settings, specifies the ANSI or Unicode character that the user pressed.  
  
 `nFlags`  
 Contains the **MF_POPUP** flag if the menu is a pop-up menu. It contains the **MF_SYSMENU** flag if the menu is a Control menu.  
  
 `pMenu`  
 Contains a pointer to the selected `CMenu`. The pointer may be temporary and should not be stored.  
  
## Return Value  
 The high-order word of the return value should contain one of the following command codes:  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|0|Tells Windows to discard the character that the user pressed and creates a short beep on the system speaker.|  
|1|Tells Windows to close the current menu.|  
|2|Informs Windows that the low-order word of the return value contains the item number for a specific item. This item is selected by Windows.|  
  
 The low-order word is ignored if the high-order word contains 0 or 1. Applications should process this message when accelerator (shortcut) keys are used to select bitmaps placed in a menu.  
  
## Remarks  
 It is sent to the `CWnd` that owns the menu. `OnMenuChar` is also called when the user presses ALT and any other key, even if the key does not correspond to a mnemonic character. In this case, `pMenu` points to the menu owned by the `CWnd`, and `nFlags` is 0.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
