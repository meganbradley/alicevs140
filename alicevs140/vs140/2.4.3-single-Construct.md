# 2.4.3 single Construct
The **single** directive identifies a construct that specifies that the associated structured block is executed by only one thread in the team (not necessarily the master thread). The syntax of the **single** directive is as follows:  
  
```  
#pragma omp single [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-linestructured-block  
```  
  
 The clause is one of the following:  
  
 **private(** *variable-list* **)**  
  
 **firstprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  
  
 **copyprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  
  
 **nowait**  
  
 There is an implicit barrier after the **single** construct unless a **nowait** clause is specified.  
  
 Restrictions to the **single** directive are as follows:  
  
-   Only a single **nowait** clause can appear on a **single** directive.  
  
-   The **copyprivate** clause must not be used with the **nowait** clause.  
  
## Cross References:
