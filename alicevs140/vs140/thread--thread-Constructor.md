# thread::thread Constructor
Constructs a `thread` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
thread() _NOEXCEPT;  
template<class Fn, class... Args>  
   explicit thread(Fn&& F, Args&&... A);  
thread(thread&& Other) _NOEXCEPT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `F`  
 An application-defined function to be executed by the thread.  
  
 `A`  
 A list of arguments to be passed to `F`.  
  
 `Other`  
 An existing `thread` object.  
  
## Remarks  
 The first constructor constructs an object that's not associated with a thread of execution. The value that's returned by a call to `get_id` for the constructed object is `thread::id()`.  
  
 The second constructor constructs an object that's associated with a new thread of execution and executes the pseudo-function `INVOKE` that's defined in [<functional\>](../vs140/-functional-.md). If not enough resources are available to start a new thread, the function throws a [system_error](../vs140/system_error-Class.md) object that has an error code of `resource_unavailable_try_again`. If the call to `F` terminates with an uncaught exception, [terminate](../vs140/terminate---exception--.md) is called.  
  
 The third constructor constructs an object that's associated with the thread that's associated with `Other`. `Other` is then set to a default-constructed state.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** thread  
  
 **Namespace:** std
