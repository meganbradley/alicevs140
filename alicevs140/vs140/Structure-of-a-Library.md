# Structure of a Library
A library contains COFF objects. Objects in a library contain functions and data that can be referenced externally by other objects in a program. An object in a library is sometimes referred to as a library member.  
  
 You can get additional information about the contents of a library by running the DUMPBIN tool with the /LINKERMEMBER option. For more information about this option, see [DUMPBIN Reference](../vs140/DUMPBIN-Reference.md).
