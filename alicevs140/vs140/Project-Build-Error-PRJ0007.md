# Project Build Error PRJ0007
Could not create output directory 'directory'.  
  
 Visual C++ failed to create an output directory. Possible reasons include:  
  
-   The directory in which the output directory was to be created is read-only.  
  
-   Computer is out of disk space.  
  
-   You specified an invalid directory path.  
  
-   User permissions are not sufficient to create the directory.
