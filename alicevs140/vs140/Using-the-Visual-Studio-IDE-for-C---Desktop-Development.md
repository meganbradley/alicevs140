# Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Integrated Development Environment (IDE) offers a set of tools that help you write and modify code, and also detect and correct errors.  
  
 In the articles in this section of the documentation, you create a standard C++ program and test its functionality by using features in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. The basic program that you create tracks how many players are playing different card games.  
  
 Here are the articles:  
  
-   [Projects and Solutions (C++)](../vs140/Walkthrough--Working-with-Projects-and-Solutions--C---.md)  
  
-   [Building a Project (C++)](../vs140/Walkthrough--Building-a-Project--C---.md)  
  
-   [Testing a Project (C++)](../vs140/Walkthrough--Testing-a-Project--C---.md)  
  
-   [Debugging a Project (C++)](../vs140/Walkthrough--Debugging-a-Project--C---.md)  
  
-   [Deploying Your Program (C++)](../vs140/Walkthrough--Deploying-Your-Program--C---.md)
