# CWnd::OnUniChar
The framework calls this member function when a key is pressed. That is, the current window has the keyboard focus and a [WM_KEYDOWN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646280) message is translated by the [TranslateMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644955) function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnUniChar(  
    UINT nChar,   
    UINT nRepCnt,   
    UINT nFlags  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nChar`|Specifies the character code of the pressed key.|  
|[in] `nRepCnt`|Specifies the repeat count for the current message. The value is the number of times the keystroke is autorepeated as a result of the user holding down the key. If the keystroke is held long enough, multiple messages are sent. However, the repeat count is not cumulative.|  
|[in] `nFlags`|Flags that specify the scan code, extended key, context code, previous key state, and transition state, as shown in the following table:<br /><br /> **0-7:** Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).<br /><br /> **8:** Specifies an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101 or 102-key keyboard. The flag is 1 if the key is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.<br /><br /> **9-12:**  Used internally by Windows.<br /><br /> **13:**  Specifies the context code. The flag is 1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise, the value is 0.<br /><br /> **14:**  Specifies the previous key state. The flag is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent, or 0 if the key is up.<br /><br /> **15:**  Specifies the transition state. The flag is 1 if the key is being released, or 0 if the key is being pressed.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_UNICHAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646288) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)]. The [WM_UNICHAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646288) message is designed to send or post Unicode characters to ANSI windows. It is equivalent to the [WM_CHAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646276) message, but uses Unicode Transformation Format-32 encoding (UTF-32), whereas the [WM_CHAR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646276) message uses UTF-16.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
