# File &lt;name&gt; cannot be registered as an COM component.
The file cannot be added to the project's references. This error occurs when a file has been corrupted, does not contain type libraries, uses an incompatible file type, or when the system does not have enough resources to complete the operation.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify that the file contains a valid type library and try again.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Re-install the product that installed the file.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The product that installed the file may not be Visual Studio.
