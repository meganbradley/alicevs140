# CComControlBase::m_spOleAdviseHolder
Provides a standard implementation of a way to hold advisory connections.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
CComPtr<IOleAdviseHolder> m_spOleAdviseHolder;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To use this data member within your control class, you must declare it as a data member in your control class. Your control class will not inherit this data member from the base class because it is declared within a union in the base class.  
  
 The interface `m_spOleAdviseHolder` implements the [IOleObject::Advise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686573) and [IOleObject::Unadvise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms693749) methods to establish and delete advisory connections to the container. The control's container must implement an advise sink by supporting the [IAdviseSink](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692513) interface.
