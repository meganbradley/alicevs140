# task::wait Method
Waits for this task to reach a terminal state. It is possible for `wait` to execute the task inline, if all of the tasks dependencies are satisfied, and it has not already been picked up for execution by a background worker.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
task_status wait() const;  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 A `task_status` value which could be either `completed` or `canceled`. If the task encountered an exception during execution, or an exception was propagated to it from an antecedent task, `wait` will throw that exception.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  In a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app, do not call `wait` in code that runs on the STA. Otherwise, the runtime throws [concurrency::invalid_operation](../vs140/invalid_operation-Class.md) because this method blocks the current thread and can cause the app to become unresponsive. However, you can call the [concurrency::task::get](../vs140/task--get-Method.md) method to receive the result of the antecedent task in a task-based continuation.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** ppltasks.h
