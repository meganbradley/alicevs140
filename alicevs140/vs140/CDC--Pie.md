# CDC::Pie
Draws a pie-shaped wedge by drawing an elliptical arc whose center and two endpoints are joined by lines.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL Pie(  
   int x1,  
   int y1,  
   int x2,  
   int y2,  
   int x3,  
   int y3,  
   int x4,  
   int y4   
);  
BOOL Pie(  
   LPCRECT lpRect,  
   POINT ptStart,  
   POINT ptEnd   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `x1`  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 `y1`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 `x2`  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the lower-right corner of the bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 `y2`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the lower-right corner of the bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 *x3*  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the arc's starting point (in logical units). This point does not have to lie exactly on the arc.  
  
 `y3`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the arc's starting point (in logical units). This point does not have to lie exactly on the arc.  
  
 `x4`  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the arc's endpoint (in logical units). This point does not have to lie exactly on the arc.  
  
 `y4`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the arc's endpoint (in logical units). This point does not have to lie exactly on the arc.  
  
 `lpRect`  
 Specifies the bounding rectangle. You can pass either a `CRect` object or a pointer to a `RECT` structure for this parameter.  
  
 `ptStart`  
 Specifies the starting point of the arc. This point does not have to lie exactly on the arc. You can pass either a [POINT](../vs140/POINT-Structure.md) structure or a [CPoint](../vs140/CPoint-Class.md) object for this parameter.  
  
 `ptEnd`  
 Specifies the endpoint of the arc. This point does not have to lie exactly on the arc. You can pass either a **POINT** structure or a `CPoint` object for this parameter.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The center of the arc is the center of the bounding rectangle specified by `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` (or by `lpRect`). The starting and ending points of the arc are specified by *x3*, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` (or by `ptStart` and `ptEnd`).  
  
 The arc is drawn with the selected pen, moving in a counterclockwise direction. Two additional lines are drawn from each endpoint to the arc's center. The pie-shaped area is filled with the current brush. If *x3* equals `x4` and `y3` equals `y4`, the result is an ellipse with a single line from the center of the ellipse to the point (*x3*, `y3`) or (`x4`, `y4`).  
  
 The figure drawn by this function extends up to but does not include the right and bottom coordinates. This means that the height of the figure is `y2` – `y1` and the width of the figure is `x2` – `x1`. Both the width and the height of the bounding rectangle must be greater than 2 units and less than 32,767 units.
