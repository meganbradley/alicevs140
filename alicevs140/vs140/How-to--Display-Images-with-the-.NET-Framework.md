# How to: Display Images with the .NET Framework
The following code example modifies the OnPaint event handler to retrieve a pointer to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics?qualifyHint=False> object for the main form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.OnPaint?qualifyHint=False> function is intended for a Windows Forms application, most likely created with a Visual Studio application wizard.  
  
 The image is represented by the <xref:System.Drawing.Image?qualifyHint=False> class. The image data is loaded from a .jpg file using the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.FromFile?qualifyHint=True> method. Before the image is drawn to the form, the form is resized to accommodate the image. The drawing of the image is performed with the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage?qualifyHint=True> method.  
  
 The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics?qualifyHint=False> and <xref:System.Drawing.Image?qualifyHint=False> classes are both in the <xref:System.Drawing?qualifyHint=True> namespace.
