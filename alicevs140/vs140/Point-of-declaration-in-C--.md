# Point of declaration in C++
A name is considered to be declared immediately after its declarator but before its (optional) initializer. (For more information on declarators, see [Declarators](assetId:///8a7b9b51-92bd-4ac0-b3fe-0c4abe771838).)  
  
 Consider this example:  
  
```  
// point_of_declaration1.cpp  
// compile with: /W1   
double dVar = 7.0;  
int main()  
{  
   double dVar = dVar;   // C4700  
}  
```  
  
 If the point of declaration were *after* the initialization, then the local `dVar` would be initialized to 7.0, the value of the global variable `dVar`. However, since that is not the case, `dVar` is initialized to an undefined value.
