# CWnd::OnCharToItem
Called when a list box with the [LBS_WANTKEYBOARDINPUT](../vs140/List-Box-Styles.md) style sends its owner a [WM_CHARTOITEM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761358) message in response to a [WM_CHAR](../vs140/CWnd--OnChar.md) message.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg int OnCharToItem(  
   UINT nChar,  
   CListBox* pListBox,  
   UINT nIndex   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nChar`  
 Specifies the value of the key pressed by the user.  
  
 `pListBox`  
 Specifies a pointer to the list box. It may be temporary.  
  
 `nIndex`  
 Specifies the current caret position.  
  
## Return Value  
 The framework calls this member function to specify the action that the application performed in response to the call. A return value of –2 indicates that the application handled all aspects of selecting the item and wants no further action by the list box. A return value of –1 indicates that the list box should perform the default action in response to the keystroke. A return value of 0 or greater specifies the zero-based index of an item in the list box and indicates that the list box should perform the default action for the keystroke on the given item.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
