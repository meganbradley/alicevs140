This section contains basic background information that will help you understand the rest of the LINQ documentation and samples.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to LINQ Queries](../Topic/Introduction%20to%20LINQ%20Queries%20\(C%23\).md)  
 Describes the three parts of the basic LINQ query operation that are common across all languages and data sources.  
  
 [LINQ and Generic Types](../Topic/LINQ%20and%20Generic%20Types%20\(C%23\).md)  
 Provides a brief introduction to generic types as they are used in LINQ.  
  
 [Basic Query Operations (LINQ)](../Topic/Basic%20LINQ%20Query%20Operations%20\(C%23\).md)  
 Describes the most common types of query operations and how they are expressed in C#.  
  
 [Data Transformations with LINQ](../vs140/Data-Transformations-with-LINQ--C#-.md)  
 Describes the various ways that you can transform data retrieved in queries.  
  
 [Type Relationships in Query Operations](../vs140/Type-Relationships-in-LINQ-Query-Operations--C#-.md)  
 Describes how types are preserved and/or transformed in the three parts of a LINQ query operation  
  
 [Query Syntax vs. Method Syntax](../Topic/Query%20Syntax%20and%20Method%20Syntax%20in%20LINQ%20\(C%23\).md)  
 Compares method syntax and query syntax as two ways to express a LINQ query.  
  
 [C# Features That Support LINQ](../Topic/C%23%20Features%20That%20Support%20LINQ.md)  
 Describes the language constructs added in C# 3.0 that support LINQ.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in C#](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Writing%20Queries%20in%20C%23%20\(LINQ\).md)
