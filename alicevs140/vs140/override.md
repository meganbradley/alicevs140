# override
The `override` keyword has essentially the same meaning and syntax in both ISO C++ and in C++ Component Extensions (C++/CLI and C++/CX). However, there are some differences in the implications of its use. For details, see these articles:  
  
 For ISO C++:  
  
-   ISO C++ [override](../vs140/override.md)  
  
-   ISO C++ [Explicit Overrides (C++)](../vs140/Explicit-Overrides--C---.md)  
  
-   (Windows Store apps) [Ref classes and structs (C++/CX)](assetId:///3d736b82-0bf0-48cf-bac1-cc9d110b70d1)  
  
-   [override  (C++ Component Extensions)](../vs140/override---C---Component-Extensions-.md)  
  
-   [Explicit Overrides  (C++ Component Extensions)](../vs140/Explicit-Overrides---C---Component-Extensions-.md)
