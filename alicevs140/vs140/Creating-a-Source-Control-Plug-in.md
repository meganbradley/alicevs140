# Creating a Source Control Plug-in
The Visual Studio SDK provides resources that enable you to add source control capability to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). It lets you use any plug-in DLL that complies with the Source Control Plug-in API outlined in this documentation.
