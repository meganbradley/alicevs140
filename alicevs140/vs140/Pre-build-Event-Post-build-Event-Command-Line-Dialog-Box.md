# Pre-build Event-Post-build Event Command Line Dialog Box
You can type pre- or post-build events for the [Build Events Pane](../vs140/Build-Events-Page--Project-Designer--C#-.md) directly in the edit box, or you can select pre- and post-build macros from a list of available macros.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Pre-build events do not run if the project is up to date and no build is triggered.  
  
## UI Element List  
 **Command line edit box**  
 Contains the events to run either for pre-build or post-build.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Add a `call` statement before all post-build commands that run .bat files. For example, `call C:\MyFile.bat` or `call C:\MyFile.bat call C:\MyFile2.bat`.  
  
 **Macros**  
 Expands the edit box to display a list of macros to insert in the command line edit box.  
  
 **Macro table**  
 Lists the available macros and its value. See Macros below for a description of each. You can select only one macro at a time to insert into the command line edit box.  
  
 **Insert**  
 Inserts into the command line edit box the macro selected in the macro table.  
  
### Macros  
 You can use any of these macros to specify locations for files, or to get the actual name of the input file in the case of multiple selections. These macros are not case-sensitive.
