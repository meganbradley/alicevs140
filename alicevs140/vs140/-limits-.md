# &lt;limits&gt;
Defines the template class `numeric_limits` and two enumerations concerning floating-point representations and rounding.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#include <limits>  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Explicit specializations of the `numeric_limits` class describe many properties of the fundamental types, including the character, integer, and floating-point types and `bool` that are implementation defined rather than fixed by the rules of the C++ language. Properties described in <limits\> include accuracy, minimum and maximum sized representations, rounding, and signaling type errors.  
  
### Enumerations  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[float_denorm_style](../vs140/-limits--enums.md#float_denorm_style_enumeration)|The enumeration describes the various methods that an implementation can choose for representing a denormalized floating-point value â€” one too small to represent as a normalized value:|  
|[float_round_style](../vs140/-limits--enums.md#float_round_style_enumeration)|The enumeration describes the various methods that an implementation can choose for rounding a floating-point value to an integer value.|  
  
### Classes  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[numeric_limits Class](../vs140/numeric_limits-Class.md)|The template class describes arithmetic properties of built-in numerical types.|
