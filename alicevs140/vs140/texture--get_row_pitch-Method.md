# texture::get_row_pitch Method
Returns the number of bytes between each row in a 2-dimensional staging texture, or between each row of a depth slice in 3-dimensional staging texture.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
unsigned int get_row_pitch() const restrict(cpu);  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 The number of bytes between each row in a 2-dimensional staging texture, or between each row of a depth slice in 3-dimensional staging texture.  
  
## Remarks  
 Given the address of any element in the first row of the 2D texture or depth slice, you can add `row_pitch` to calculate the address of the same element in the second row of the same texture or depth slice, and similarly for subsequent rows. The value of `row_pitch` compensates for the size of the texture elements as well as any additional padding that might exist between rows within the texture or depth slice. The value of `row_pitch` does not compensate for any additional padding between depth slices in a 3-dimensional texture, and canâ€™t be used to move between depth slices; to move between depth slices, use the [texture::get_depth_pitch Method](../vs140/texture--get_depth_pitch-Method.md) instead.
