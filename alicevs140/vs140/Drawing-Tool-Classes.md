 The base class for GDI drawing tools.  
  
 [CBrush](../vs140/CBrush-Class.md)

 [CPen](../vs140/CPen-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI pen that can be selected as the current pen in a device context. Pens are used for drawing the border lines of objects.  
  
 [CFont](../vs140/CFont-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI font that can be selected as the current font in a device context.  
  
 [CBitmap](../vs140/CBitmap-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI bitmap, providing an interface for manipulating bitmaps.  
  
 [CPalette](../vs140/CPalette-Class.md)
