# How to: Add Nodes to the Workspace from the Start View
This topic describes how to add global nodes to the [workspace](../vs140/XML-Schema-Designer-Workspace.md) from the [Start View](../vs140/Start-View.md).  
  
### To add nodes to the workspace from the Start View  
  
1.  Follow the steps in [How to: Create and Edit an XSD Schema File](../vs140/How-to--Create-and-Edit-an-XSD-Schema-File.md).  
  
2.  Right-click in the XML Editor and select **View Designer**.  
  
     The Start View appears.  
  
     In the **Schema Set Details** section, notice that there are two (**2**) **Global Complex Types**.  
  
3.  Click on the **add** link to the right of the **Global Complex Types** heading.  
  
     The `USAddress` and `PurchaseOrderType` complex type nodes will appear on the design surface of the Graph View.
