# operator* (&lt;complex&gt;)
Multiplies two complex numbers, one or both of which may belong to the subset of the type for the real and imaginary parts.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> operator*(  
      const complex<Type>& _Left,  
      const complex<Type>& _Right  
   );  
template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> operator*(  
      const complex<Type>& _Left,  
      const Type& _Right  
   );  
template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> operator*(  
      const Type& _Left,  
      const complex<Type>& _Right  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Left`  
 The first of two complex numbers or a number that is of the parameter type for a complex number that is to be multiplied by the * operation.  
  
 `_Right`  
 The second of two complex numbers or a number that is of the parameter type for a complex number that is to be multiplied by the * operation.  
  
## Return Value  
 The complex number that results from the multiplication of the two numbers whose value and type are specified by the parameter inputs.  
  
## Remarks  
 The operation is overloaded so that simple arithmetic operations can be executed without the conversion of the data to a particular format.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// complex_op_mult.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <complex>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
   double pi = 3.14159265359;  
  
   // Example of the first member function  
   // type complex<double> times type complex<double>  
   complex <double> cl1 ( polar (3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   complex <double> cr1 ( polar (2.0 , pi / 3 ) );  
   complex <double> cs1 = cl1 * cr1;  
  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl1 = " << cl1 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr1 = " << cr1 << endl;  
   cout << "Product of two complex numbers is: cs1 = " << cs1 << endl;  
   double abscs1 = abs ( cs1 );  
   double argcs1 = arg ( cs1 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cs1 is: " << abscs1 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cs1 is: "<< argcs1 << " radians, which is "  
        << argcs1 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;  
  
   // Example of the second member function  
   // type complex<double> times type double  
   complex <double> cl2 ( polar ( 3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   double cr2 =5;  
   complex <double> cs2 = cl2 * cr2;  
  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl2 = " << cl2 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr2 = " << cr2 << endl;  
   cout << "Product of two complex numbers is: cs2 = " << cs2 << endl;  
   double abscs2 = abs ( cs2 );  
   double argcs2 = arg ( cs2 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cs2 is: " << abscs2 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cs2 is: "<< argcs2 << " radians, which is "  
        << argcs2 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;  
  
   // Example of the third member function  
   // type double times type complex<double>  
   double cl3 = 5;  
   complex <double> cr3 ( polar (3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   complex <double> cs3 = cl3 * cr3;  
  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl3 = " << cl3 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr3 = " << cr3 << endl;  
   cout << "Product of two complex numbers is: cs3 = " << cs3 << endl;  
   double abscs3 = abs ( cs3 );  
   double argcs3 = arg ( cs3 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cs3 is: " << abscs3 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cs3 is: "<< argcs3 << " radians, which is "  
        << argcs3 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;  
}  
```  
  
## Sample Output  
 The following is output on x86.  
  
```  
The left-side complex number is cl1 = (2.59808,1.5)  
The right-side complex number is cr1 = (1,1.73205)  
Product of two complex numbers is: cs1 = (-6.20837e-013,6)  
The modulus of cs1 is: 6  
The argument of cs1 is: 1.5708 radians, which is 90 degrees.  
  
The left-side complex number is cl2 = (2.59808,1.5)  
The right-side complex number is cr2 = 5  
Product of two complex numbers is: cs2 = (12.9904,7.5)  
The modulus of cs2 is: 15  
The argument of cs2 is: 0.523599 radians, which is 30 degrees.
