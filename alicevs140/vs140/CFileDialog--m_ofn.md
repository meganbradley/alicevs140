# CFileDialog::m_ofn
`m_ofn` is a structure of type `OPENFILENAME`. The data in this structure represents the current state of the `CFileDialog`.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use this structure to initialize the appearance of a **File Open** or **File Save As** dialog box after you construct it but before you display it with the [DoModal](../vs140/CFileDialog--DoModal.md) method. For example, you can set the `lpstrTitle` member of `m_ofn` to the caption you want the dialog box to have.  
  
 With the [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)] style of [CFileDialog](../vs140/CFileDialog-Class.md), `m_ofn` is not guaranteed to always match the state of the dialog box. It is synchronized with the dialog box in earlier versions of Windows. See [CFileDialog::ApplyOFNToShellDialog](../vs140/CFileDialog--ApplyOFNToShellDialog.md) and [CFileDialog::UpdateOFNFromShellDialog](../vs140/CFileDialog--UpdateOFNFromShellDialog.md) for more information about synchronizing the `m_ofn` structure and the `CFileDialog` state under [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)] style file dialogs do not support certain members and flags of the `CFileDialog`. As a result, these will have no effect.  
  
 The following is a list of the members that are not supported by [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)]:  
  
-   `lpstrCustomFilter`  
  
-   `lpstrInitialDir`  
  
-   `lCustData`  
  
-   `lpfnHook`  
  
-   `lpTemplateName`  
  
 The following flags are not supported and therefore have no effect when you use the [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)] style of `CFileDialog`:  
  
-   OFN_ENABLEHOOK  
  
-   OFN_ENABLEINCLUDENOTIFY  
  
-   OFN_ENABLETEMPLATE  
  
-   OFN_ENABLETEMPLATEHANDLE  
  
-   OFN_EXPLORER  
  
-   OFN_EXTENSIONDIFFERENT  
  
-   OFN_HIDEREADONLY  
  
-   OFN_LONGNAMES - effectively always on in [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)]  
  
-   OFN_NOLONGNAMES - effectively always off in [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)]  
  
-   OFN_NONETWORKBUTTON - effectively always on in [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)]  
  
-   OFN_READONLY  
  
-   OFN_SHOWHELP  
  
 For more information about this structure, see the [OPENFILENAME](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646839) structure in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winSDK_md.md)]. For more information about the different behavior of the `CFileDialog` under [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../vs140/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)], see [CFileDialog Class](../vs140/CFileDialog-Class.md).
