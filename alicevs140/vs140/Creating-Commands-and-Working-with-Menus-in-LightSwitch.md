# Creating Commands and Working with Menus in LightSwitch
In LightSwitch applications, menus let the user display screens, and commands let the user perform actions. You can create commands and display them as buttons on a screen’s toolbar.  
  
 In this set of lessons you’ll learn how to create commands, customize menus, and specify the home screen.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These lessons build upon the My First Application project that you last modified in the [Using a Parameterized Query on a LightSwitch Screen](../vs140/Using-a-Parameterized-Query-on-a-LightSwitch-Screen.md) lesson. If your application isn't already open in Visual Studio, on the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open Project** to open it.
