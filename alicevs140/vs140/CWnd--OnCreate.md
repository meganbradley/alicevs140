# CWnd::OnCreate
The framework calls this member function when an application requests that the Windows window be created by calling the [Create](../vs140/CWnd--Create.md) or [CreateEx](../vs140/CWnd--CreateEx.md) member function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg int OnCreate(  
   LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpCreateStruct`  
 Points to a [CREATESTRUCT](../vs140/CREATESTRUCT-Structure.md) structure that contains information about the `CWnd` object being created.  
  
## Return Value  
 `OnCreate` must return 0 to continue the creation of the `CWnd` object. If the application returns â€“1, the window will be destroyed.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `CWnd` object receives this call after the window is created but before it becomes visible. `OnCreate` is called before the **Create** or `CreateEx` member function returns.  
  
 Override this member function to perform any needed initialization of a derived class.  
  
 The `CREATESTRUCT` structure contains copies of the parameters used to create the window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
