# ToggleHUD
Toggles the graphics diagnostics *HUD* (Head-Up Display) overlay on or off.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
void ToggleHUD();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The graphics diagnostics HUD is displayed in the upper-left corner of the app that's running under graphics diagnostics. It displays run-time information about the app and about graphics information capture, and messages that are added by calling the [AddMessage](../vs140/AddMessage.md) member function.  
  
 To toggle the HUD, you don't have to be actively capturing graphics informationâ€”that is, it can be toggled through an instance of the `VsgDbg` class, but the [Init](../vs140/Init.md) member function doesn't have to be called first.
