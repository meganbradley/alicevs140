# Item cannot be added to the Toolbox.
This error generally occurs when you attempt to add an item for which the Toolbox cannot display a shortcut icon.  
  
 Items which the Toolbox can display include:  
  
-   Controls and .NET Framework components installed on your local machine.  
  
 **Note** Controls and components for [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../vs140/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] Web forms must have an [AspNetHostingPermission.Level Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.aspnethostingpermission.level.aspx) of "Unlimited" to be displayed in the Toolbox.  
  
-   Selected text dragged or pasted from a Visual Studio editor, such as code snippets.  
  
 Items which the Toolbox cannot display include:  
  
-   Excel workbook files.  
  
-   .NET Framework assemblies installed on shared network servers.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  An assembly added from a UNC path is not fully trusted, so it is not granted sufficient permissions to be displayed in the Toolbox.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Use the **Customize Toolbox** dialog box to add a control or component that is installed on your local machine to the active Toolbox tab.  
  
     \- or -  
  
2.  Drag or paste selected text from a Visual Studio editor onto the Toolbox.
