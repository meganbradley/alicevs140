# Concurrency Runtime Walkthroughs
The scenario-based topics in this section show how to use many of the features of the Concurrency Runtime.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Walkthrough: Connecting Using Tasks and XML HTTP Request (IXHR2)](../vs140/Walkthrough--Connecting-Using-Tasks-and-XML-HTTP-Requests.md)  
 Shows how to use the [IXMLHTTPRequest2](assetId:///bbc11c4a-aecf-4d6d-8275-3e852e309908) and [IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback](assetId:///aa4b3f4c-6e28-458b-be25-6cce8865fc71) interfaces together with tasks to send HTTP GET and POST requests to a web service in a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating an Agent-Based Application](../vs140/Walkthrough--Creating-an-Agent-Based-Application.md)  
 Describes how to create a basic agent-based application.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating a Dataflow Agent](../vs140/Walkthrough--Creating-a-Dataflow-Agent.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create agent-based applications that are based on dataflow, instead of on control flow.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating an Image-Processing Network](../vs140/Walkthrough--Creating-an-Image-Processing-Network.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a network of asynchronous message blocks that perform image processing.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Implementing Futures](../vs140/Walkthrough--Implementing-Futures.md)  
 Shows how to asynchronously compute values for later use.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Using join to Prevent Deadlock](../vs140/Walkthrough--Using-join-to-Prevent-Deadlock.md)  
 Uses the dining philosophers problem to illustrate how to use the [concurrency::join](../vs140/join-Class.md) class to prevent deadlock in your application.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Removing Work from a User-Interface Thread](../vs140/Walkthrough--Removing-Work-from-a-User-Interface-Thread.md)  
 Demonstrates how to improve the performance of an MFC application that draws the Mandelbrot fractal.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Using the Concurrency Runtime in a COM-Enabled Application](../vs140/Walkthrough--Using-the-Concurrency-Runtime-in-a-COM-Enabled-Application.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the Concurrency Runtime in an application that uses the Component Object Model (COM).  
  
 [Walkthough: Adapting Existing Code to Use Lightweight Tasks](../vs140/Walkthrough--Adapting-Existing-Code-to-Use-Lightweight-Tasks.md)  
 Shows how to adapt existing code that uses the Windows API to create and execute a thread to use a lightweight task.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating a Custom Message Block](../vs140/Walkthrough--Creating-a-Custom-Message-Block.md)  
 Describes how to create a custom message block type that orders incoming messages by priority.
