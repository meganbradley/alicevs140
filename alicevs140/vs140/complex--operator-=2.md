# complex::operator-=2
Divides a target complex number by a divisor, which may be complex or be the same type as are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<class Other>  
   complex<Type>& operator/=(  
      const complex<Other>& _ComplexNum  
   );  
complex<Type>& operator/=(  
   const Type& _RealPart  
   );  
complex<Type>& operator/=(  
   const complex<Type>& _ComplexNum  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_ComplexNum`  
 A complex number to be subtracted from the target complex number.  
  
 `_RealPart`  
 A real number to be subtracted from the target complex number.  
  
## Return Value  
 A complex number that has been divided by the number specified as a parameter.  
  
## Remarks  
 The operation is overloaded so that simple arithmetic operations can be executed without the conversion of the data to a particular format.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// complex_op_de.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <complex>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
   double pi = 3.14159265359;  
  
   // Example of the first member function  
   // type complex<double> divided by type complex<double>  
   complex <double> cl1 ( polar (3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   complex <double> cr1 ( polar (2.0 , pi / 3 ) );  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl1 = " << cl1 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr1 = " << cr1 << endl;  
  
   complex <double> cs1 = cl1 / cr1;  
   cout << "The quotient of the two complex numbers is: cs1 = cl1 /cr1 = "  
        << cs1 << endl;  
  
   // This is equivalent to the following operation  
   cl1 /= cr1;  
   cout << "Quotient of two complex numbers is also: cl1 /= cr1 = "  
        << cl1 << endl;  
  
   double abscl1 = abs ( cl1 );  
   double argcl1 = arg ( cl1 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cl1 is: " << abscl1 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cl1 is: "<< argcl1 << " radians, which is "   
        << argcl1 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;   
  
   // Example of the second member function  
   // type complex<double> divided by type double  
   complex <double> cl2 ( polar (3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   double cr2 =5;  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl2 = " << cl2 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr2 = " << cr2 << endl;  
  
   complex <double> cs2 = cl2 / cr2;  
   cout << "The quotient of the two complex numbers is: cs2 /= cl2 cr2 = "   
        << cs2 << endl;  
  
   // This is equivalent to the following operation  
   cl2 /= cr2;  
   cout << "Quotient of two complex numbers is also: cl2 = /cr2 = "  
        << cl2 << endl;  
  
   double abscl2 = abs ( cl2 );  
   double argcl2 = arg ( cl2 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cl2 is: " << abscl2 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cl2 is: "<< argcl2 << " radians, which is "   
        << argcl2 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The left-side complex number is cl1 = (2.59808,1.5)**  
**The right-side complex number is cr1 = (1,1.73205)**  
**The quotient of the two complex numbers is: cs1 = cl1 /cr1 = (1.29904,-0.75)**  
**Quotient of two complex numbers is also: cl1 /= cr1 = (1.29904,-0.75)**  
**The modulus of cl1 is: 1.5**  
**The argument of cl1 is: -0.523599 radians, which is -30 degrees.**  
**The left-side complex number is cl2 = (2.59808,1.5)**  
**The right-side complex number is cr2 = 5**  
**The quotient of the two complex numbers is: cs2 /= cl2 cr2 = (0.519615,0.3)**  
**Quotient of two complex numbers is also: cl2 = /cr2 = (0.519615,0.3)**  
**The modulus of cl2 is: 0.6**  
**The argument of cl2 is: 0.523599 radians, which is 30 degrees.**
