# basic_string::find
Searches a string in a forward direction for the first occurrence of a substring that matches a specified sequence of characters.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_type find(  
    value_type _Ch,   
    size_type _Off = 0  
) const;  
size_type find(  
    const value_type* _Ptr,  
    size_type _Off = 0  
) const;  
size_type find(  
    const value_type* _Ptr,   
    size_type _Off,  
    size_type _Count  
) const;  
size_type find(  
    const basic_string<CharType, Traits, Allocator>& _Str,  
    size_type _Off = 0  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Ch`  
 The character value for which the member function is to search.  
  
 `_Off`  
 Index of the position at which the search is to begin.  
  
 `_Ptr`  
 The C-string for which the member function is to search.  
  
 `_Count`  
 The number of characters, counting forward from the first character, in the C-string for which the member function is to search.  
  
 `_Str`  
 The string for which the member function is to search.  
  
## Return Value  
 The index of the first character of the substring searched for when successful; otherwise `npos`.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// basic_string_find.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <string>  
#include <iostream>

   // searches for a single character in a string  
   string str1 ( "Hello Everyone" );

      cout << "The index of the 1st 'e' found after the 3rd"  
           << " position in str1 is: " << indexCh1a << endl;
