# CWnd::OnParentNotify
A parent's `OnParentNotify` member function is called by the framework when its child window is created or destroyed, or when the user clicks a mouse button while the cursor is over the child window.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnParentNotify(  
   UINT message,  
   LPARAM lParam   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `message`  
 Specifies the event for which the parent is being notified and the identifier of the child window. The event is the low-order word of `message`. If the event is `WM_CREATE` or `WM_DESTROY`, the high-order word of `message` is the identifier of the child window; otherwise, the high-order word is undefined. The event (low-order word of `message`) can be any of these values:  
  
-   `WM_CREATE` The child window is being created.  
  
-   `WM_DESTROY` The child window is being destroyed.  
  
-   `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` The user has placed the mouse cursor over the child window and clicked the left mouse button.  
  
-   `WM_MBUTTONDOWN` The user has placed the mouse cursor over the child window and clicked the middle mouse button.  
  
-   `WM_RBUTTONDOWN` The user has placed the mouse cursor over the child window and clicked the right mouse button.  
  
 `lParam`  
 If the event (low-order word) of `message` is `WM_CREATE` or `WM_DESTROY`, `lParam` specifies the window handle of the child window; otherwise `lParam` contains the x and y coordinates of the cursor. The x coordinate is in the low-order word and the y coordinate is in the high-order word.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the child window is being created, the system calls `OnParentNotify` just before the [Create](../vs140/CWnd--Create.md) member function that creates the window returns. When the child window is being destroyed, the system calls `OnParentNotify` before any processing takes place to destroy the window.  
  
 `OnParentNotify` is called for all ancestor windows of the child window, including the top-level window.  
  
 All child windows except those that have the [WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY](../vs140/Extended-Window-Styles.md) style send this message to their parent windows. By default, child windows in a dialog box have the **WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY** style unless the child window was created without this style by calling the [CreateEx](../vs140/CWnd--CreateEx.md) member function.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
