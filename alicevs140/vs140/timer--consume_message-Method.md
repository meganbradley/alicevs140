# timer::consume_message Method
Consumes a message previously offered by the `timer` and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * consume_message(  
   runtime_object_identity _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being consumed.  
  
## Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
## Remarks  
 Similar to `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to `reserve`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency
