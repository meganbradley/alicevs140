# task Class (Concurrency Runtime)
The Parallel Patterns Library (PPL)             `task` class. A             `task` object represents work that can be executed asynchronously, and concurrently with other tasks and parallel work produced by parallel algorithms in the Concurrency Runtime. It produces a result of type             `_ResultType` on successful completion. Tasks of type             `task<void>` produce no result. A task can be waited upon and canceled independently of other tasks. It can also be composed with other tasks using continuations(            `then`), and join(            `when_all`) and choice(            `when_any`) patterns.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template <  
   typename             _Type  
>  
class task;  
  
template <>  
class task<void>;  
  
template<  
   typename             _ReturnType  
>  
class task;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Type`  
 `T`  
 `_ReturnType`  
 The result type of this task.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Typedefs  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`result_type`|The type of the result an object of this class produces.|  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[task::task Constructor](#task__task_constructor)|Overloaded. Constructs a                                         `task` object.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[task::get Method](#task__get_method)|Overloaded. Returns the result this task produced. If the task is not in a terminal state, a call to                                         `get` will wait for the task to finish. This method does not return a value when called on a task with a                                         `result_type` of                                         `void`.|  
|[task::is_apartment_aware Method](#task__is_apartment_aware_method)|Determines whether the task unwraps a Windows Runtime                                         `IAsyncInfo` interface or is descended from such a task.|  
|[task::is_done Method (Concurrency Runtime)](#task__is_done_method__concurrency_runtime_)|Determines if the task is completed.|  
|[task::scheduler Method (Concurrency Runtime)](#task__scheduler_method__concurrency_runtime_)|Returns the scheduler for this task|  
|[task::then Method](#task__then_method)|Overloaded. Adds a continuation task to this task.|  
|[task::wait Method](#task__wait_method)|Waits for this task to reach a terminal state. It is possible for                                         `wait` to execute the task inline, if all of the tasks dependencies are satisfied, and it has not already been picked up for execution by a background worker.|  
  
### Public Operators  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[task::operator!= Operator](#task__operator_neq_operator)|Overloaded. Determines whether two                                         `task` objects represent different internal tasks.|  
|[task::operator= Operator](#task__operator_eq_operator)|Overloaded. Replaces the contents of one                                         `task` object with another.|  
|[task::operator== Operator](#task__operator_eq_eq_operator)|Overloaded. Determines whether two                                         `task` objects represent the same internal task.|

 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="task__get_method"></a>  task::get Method  
 Returns the result this task produced. If the task is not in a terminal state, a call to                 `get` will wait for the task to finish. This method does not return a value when called on a task with a                 `result_type` of                 `void`.  
  
```  
_ReturnType get() const;  
  
void get() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The result of the task.  
  
### Remarks  
 If the task is canceled, a call to                         `get` will throw a                         [task_canceled](../vs140/task_canceled-Class.md) exception. If the task encountered an different exception or an exception was propagated to it from an antecedent task, a call to                         `get` will throw that exception.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  In a                             [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app, do not call                             [concurrency::task::wait](#task__wait_method) or                             `get` (                            `wait` calls                             `get`) in code that runs on the STA. Otherwise, the runtime throws                             [concurrency::invalid_operation](../vs140/invalid_operation-Class.md) because these methods block the current thread and can cause the app to become unresponsive. However, you can call the                             `get` method to receive the result of the antecedent task in a task-based continuation because the result is immediately available.  
  
##  <a name="task__is_apartment_aware_method"></a>  task::is_apartment_aware Method  
 Determines whether the task unwraps a Windows Runtime                 `IAsyncInfo` interface or is descended from such a task.  
  
```  
bool is_apartment_aware() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the task unwraps an                         `IAsyncInfo` interface or is descended from such a task,                         `false` otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="task__is_done_method__concurrency_runtime_"></a>  task::is_done Method (Concurrency Runtime)  
 Determines if the task is completed.  
  
```  
bool is_done() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 True if the task has completed, false otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 The function returns true if the task is completed or canceled (with or without user exception).  
  
##  <a name="task__operator_neq_operator"></a>  task::operator!= Operator  
 Determines whether two                 `task` objects represent different internal tasks.  
  
```  
bool operator!=(  
   const task<_ReturnType>&                 _Rhs  
) const;  
  
bool operator!=(  
   const task<void>&                 _Rhs  
) const;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Rhs`  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the objects refer to different underlying tasks, and                         `false` otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="task__operator_eq_operator"></a>  task::operator= Operator  
 Replaces the contents of one                 `task` object with another.  
  
```  
task& operator=(  
   const task&                 _Other  
);  
  
task& operator=(  
   task&&                 _Other  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Other`  
 The source                                 `task` object.  
  
### Return Value  
  
### Remarks  
 As                         `task` behaves like a smart pointer, after a copy assignment, this                         `task` objects represents the same actual task as                         `_Other` does.  
  
##  <a name="task__operator_eq_eq_operator"></a>  task::operator== Operator  
 Determines whether two                 `task` objects represent the same internal task.  
  
```  
bool operator==(  
   const task<_ReturnType>&                 _Rhs  
) const;  
  
bool operator==(  
   const task<void>&                 _Rhs  
) const;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Rhs`  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the objects refer to the same underlying task, and                         `false` otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="task__scheduler_method__concurrency_runtime_"></a>  task::scheduler Method (Concurrency Runtime)  
 Returns the scheduler for this task  
  
```  
scheduler_ptr scheduler() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the scheduler  
  
##  <a name="task__task_constructor"></a>  task::task Constructor  
 Constructs a                 `task` object.  
  
```  
task();  
  
template<  
   typename                 _Ty  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) explicit task(_Ty                 _Param);  
  
template<  
   typename                 _Ty  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) explicit task(_Ty                 _Param, const task_options&                 _TaskOptions);  
  
task(  
   const task&                 _Other  
);  
  
task(  
   task&&                 _Other  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Ty`  
 The type of the parameter from which the task is to be constructed.  
  
 `_Param`  
 The parameter from which the task is to be constructed. This could be a lambda, a function object, a                                 `task_completion_event<result_type>` object, or a Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo if you are using tasks in your Windows Store app. The lambda or function object should be a type equivalent to                                 `std::function<X(void)>`, where X can be a variable of type                                 `result_type`,                                 `task<result_type>`, or a Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo in Windows Store apps.  
  
 `_TaskOptions`  
 The task options include cancellation token, scheduler etc  
  
 `_Other`  
 The source                                 `task` object.  
  
### Remarks  
 The default constructor for a                         `task` is only present in order to allow tasks to be used within containers. A default constructed task cannot be used until you assign a valid task to it. Methods such as                         `get`,                         `wait` or                         `then` will throw an                         [invalid_argument](../vs140/invalid_argument-Class.md) exception when called on a default constructed task.  
  
 A task that is created from a                         `task_completion_event` will complete (and have its continuations scheduled) when the task completion event is set.  
  
 The version of the constructor that takes a cancellation token creates a task that can be canceled using the                         `cancellation_token_source` the token was obtained from. Tasks created without a cancellation token are not cancelable.  
  
 Tasks created from a                         `Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo` interface or a lambda that returns an                         `IAsyncInfo` interface reach their terminal state when the enclosed Windows Runtime asynchronous operation or action completes. Similarly, tasks created from a lamda that returns a                         `task<result_type>` reach their terminal state when the inner task reaches its terminal state, and not when the lamda returns.  
  
 `task` behaves like a smart pointer and is safe to pass around by value. It can be accessed by multiple threads without the need for locks.  
  
 The constructor overloads that take a Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo interface or a lambda returning such an interface, are only available to Windows Store apps.

##  <a name="task__then_method"></a>  task::then Method  
 Adds a continuation task to this task.  
  
```  
template<  
   typename                 _Function  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) auto then(const _Function&                 _Func) const -> typename details::_ContinuationTypeTraits<                _Function, _ReturnType>::_TaskOfType;  
  
template<  
   typename                 _Function  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) auto then(const _Function&                 _Func, const task_options&                 _TaskOptions) const -> typename details::_ContinuationTypeTraits<                _Function, _ReturnType>::_TaskOfType;  
  
template<  
   typename                 _Function  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) auto then(const _Function&                 _Func, cancellation_token                 _CancellationToken, task_continuation_context                 _ContinuationContext) const -> typename details::_ContinuationTypeTraits<                _Function, _ReturnType>::_TaskOfType;  
  
template<  
   typename                 _Function  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) auto then(const _Function&                 _Func, const task_options&                 _TaskOptions = task_options()) const -> typename details::_ContinuationTypeTraits<                _Function, void>::_TaskOfType;  
  
template<  
   typename                 _Function  
>  
__declspec(  
   noinline  
) auto then(const _Function&                 _Func, cancellation_token                 _CancellationToken, task_continuation_context                 _ContinuationContext) const -> typename details::_ContinuationTypeTraits<                _Function, void>::_TaskOfType;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Function`  
 The type of the function object that will be invoked by this task.  
  
 `_Func`  
 The continuation function to execute when this task completes. This continuation function must take as input a variable of either                                 `result_type` or                                 `task<result_type>`, where                                 `result_type` is the type of the result this task produces.  
  
 `_TaskOptions`  
 The task options include cancellation token, scheduler and continuation context. By default the former 3 options are inherited from the antecedent task  
  
 `_CancellationToken`  
 The cancellation token to associate with the continuation task. A continuation task that is created without a cancellation token will inherit the token of its antecedent task.  
  
 `_ContinuationContext`  
 A variable that specifies where the continuation should execute. This variable is only useful when used in a Windows Store style app. For more information, see                                 [task_continuation_context](../vs140/task_continuation_context-Class.md)  
  
### Return Value  
 The newly created continuation task. The result type of the returned task is determined by what                         `_Func` returns.  
  
### Remarks  
 The overloads of                         `then` that take a lambda or functor that returns a Windows::Foundation::IAsyncInfo interface, are only available to Windows Store apps.  
  
 For more information on how to use task continuations to compose asynchronous work, see                         [Task Parallelism (Concurrency Runtime)](../vs140/Task-Parallelism--Concurrency-Runtime-.md).  
  
##  <a name="task__wait_method"></a>  task::wait Method  
 Waits for this task to reach a terminal state. It is possible for                 `wait` to execute the task inline, if all of the tasks dependencies are satisfied, and it has not already been picked up for execution by a background worker.  
  
```  
task_status wait() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 A                         `task_status` value which could be either                         `completed` or                         `canceled`. If the task encountered an exception during execution, or an exception was propagated to it from an antecedent task,                         `wait` will throw that exception.  
  
### Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  In a                             [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app, do not call                             `wait` in code that runs on the STA. Otherwise, the runtime throws                             [concurrency::invalid_operation](../vs140/invalid_operation-Class.md) because this method blocks the current thread and can cause the app to become unresponsive. However, you can call the                             [concurrency::task::get](#task__get_method) method to receive the result of the antecedent task in a task-based continuation.
