# LightSwitch Guided Tour
This guided tour is a set of lessons that introduce you to the basic capabilities of LightSwitch, a development environment that makes it easy to create data-centric business applications that can run on a variety of devices. The lessons step you through the process of creating an application, and familiarize you with the LightSwitch development environment along the way.  
  
 Each step builds on the last, so please follow the lessons sequentially.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 The LightSwitch Guided Tour uses an Open Data Protocol (OData) service to connect to the Northwind database. You’ll need Internet access to access the database.  
  
 Some prior knowledge of programming in JavaScript and Visual Basic or Visual C# is helpful, but not necessary. Any code that you have to write is provided for you.  
  
## Next Steps  
 In the first set of lessons, you’ll learn how to build a simple application in four steps.  
  
 First lesson: [Creating Your First LightSwitch Application](../vs140/Creating-Your-First-LightSwitch-Application.md)
