# ATL Control Containment FAQ
This section covers questions related to hosting controls with ATL.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In Visual C++ .NET, the window class **"AtlAxWin"** is renamed to **"AtlAxWin80"**. You can still use **"AtlAxWin"** if you use the hosting code in atl.dll (shipped with Visual C++ 6.0 and now a system .dll).
