# CView::OnScroll
Called by the framework to determine whether scrolling is possible.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual BOOL OnScroll(  
   UINT nScrollCode,  
   UINT nPos,  
   BOOL bDoScroll = TRUE   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nScrollCode`  
 A scroll-bar code that indicates the user's scrolling request. This parameter is composed of two parts: a low-order byte, which determines the type of scrolling occurring horizontally, and a high-order byte, which determines the type of scrolling occurring vertically:  
  
-   **SB_BOTTOM** Scrolls to bottom.  
  
-   **SB_LINEDOWN** Scrolls one line down.  
  
-   **SB_LINEUP** Scrolls one line up.  
  
-   **SB_PAGEDOWN** Scrolls one page down.  
  
-   **SB_PAGEUP** Scrolls one page up.  
  
-   **SB_THUMBTRACK** Drags scroll box to specified position. The current position is specified in `nPos`.  
  
-   **SB_TOP** Scrolls to top.  
  
 `nPos`  
 Contains the current scroll-box position if the scroll-bar code is **SB_THUMBTRACK**; otherwise it is not used. Depending on the initial scroll range, `nPos` may be negative and should be cast to an `int` if necessary.  
  
 `bDoScroll`  
 Determines whether you should actually do the specified scrolling action. If **TRUE,** then scrolling should take place; if **FALSE**, then scrolling should not occur.  
  
## Return Value  
 If `bDoScroll` is **TRUE** and the view was actually scrolled, then return nonzero; otherwise 0. If `bDoScroll` is **FALSE**, then return the value that you would have returned if `bDoScroll` were **TRUE**, even though you don't actually do the scrolling.  
  
## Remarks  
 In one case this function is called by the framework with `bDoScroll` set to **TRUE** when the view receives a scrollbar message. In this case, you should actually scroll the view. In the other case this function is called with `bDoScroll` set to **FALSE** when an OLE item is initially dragged into the auto-scrolling region of a drop target before scrolling actually takes place. In this case, you should not actually scroll the view.
