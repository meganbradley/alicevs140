# Project Types Architecture
This section contains detailed information about the architecture of project types in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Elements of a Project Model](../Topic/Elements%20of%20a%20Project%20Model.md)  
 Lists the services a project type can consume and the interfaces it must implement.  
  
 [Project Model Core Components](../Topic/Project%20Model%20Core%20Components.md)  
 Describes the interfaces project types both must implement and optionally can implement to provide additional functionality.  
  
 [When to Create Project Types](../vs140/When-to-Create-Project-Types.md)  
 Helps you decide when you must create a project type and when you can use another [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] extensibility feature such as VSPackages and editors to achieve the same goal.  
  
 [Hierarchies and Selection](../vs140/Hierarchies-and-Selection.md)  
 Describes how [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] uses hierarchies and selection context to provide a consistent and simplified user experience.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Project Subtypes](../Topic/Project%20Subtypes.md)  
 Explains how project subtypes let you customize the behavior of the project systems of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../vs140/includes/vcprvc_md.md)].  
  
 [Project Types](../vs140/Project-Types.md)  
 Provides an overview of projects as the basic building blocks of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). Links are provided to additional topics that explain how projects control building and compiling code.
