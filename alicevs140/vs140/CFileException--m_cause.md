# CFileException::m_cause
Contains values defined by a `CFileException` enumerated type.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int m_cause;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This data member is a public variable of type `int`. The enumerators and their meanings are as follows:  
  
-   `CFileException::none` 0: No error occurred.  
  
-   `CFileException::genericException` 1: An unspecified error occurred.  
  
-   `CFileException::fileNotFound` 2: The file could not be located.  
  
-   `CFileException::badPath` 3: All or part of the path is invalid.  
  
-   `CFileException::tooManyOpenFiles` 4: The permitted number of open files was exceeded.  
  
-   `CFileException::accessDenied` 5: The file could not be accessed.  
  
-   `CFileException::invalidFile` 6: There was an attempt to use an invalid file handle.  
  
-   `CFileException::removeCurrentDir` 7: The current working directory cannot be removed.  
  
-   `CFileException::directoryFull` 8: There are no more directory entries.  
  
-   `CFileException::badSeek` 9: There was an error trying to set the file pointer.  
  
-   `CFileException::hardIO` 10: There was a hardware error.  
  
-   `CFileException::sharingViolation` 11: SHARE.EXE was not loaded, or a shared region was locked.  
  
-   `CFileException::lockViolation` 12: There was an attempt to lock a region that was already locked.  
  
-   `CFileException::diskFull` 14: The disk is full.  
  
-   `CFileException::endOfFile` 15: The end of file was reached.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  These `CFileException` cause enumerators are distinct from the `CArchiveException` cause enumerators.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  `CArchiveException::generic` is deprecated. Use `genericException` instead. If `generic` is used in an application and built with /clr, the resulting syntax errors are not easy to decipher.
