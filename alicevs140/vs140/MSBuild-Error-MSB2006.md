# MSBuild Error MSB2006
**The project file does not contain the root element <{0}>.**  
  
 The root element name is not spelled correctly or is not recognized by [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../vs140/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)].  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check the spelling of the element name.  
  
-   Check whether the project file has been modified or corrupted. If it has been modified or corrupted, open the project in the version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] in which it was created, save it, and then attempt to convert it again.
