# Changing the Properties of a Resource
### To edit the properties of a resource  
  
1.  In [Resource View](../vs140/Resource-View-Window.md), right-click the resource you want to edit and choose **Properties** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     **Note** If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../vs140/How-to--Create-a-Resource-Script-File.md).  
  
2.  In the [Properties window](../vs140/Properties-Window.md), change the properties of your resource.  
  
### To undo a change you've made to the properties of a resource  
  
1.  Make sure your resource has focus in Resource View.  
  
2.  Choose **Undo** from the **Edit** menu.
