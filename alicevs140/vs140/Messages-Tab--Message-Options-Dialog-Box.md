# Messages Tab, Message Options Dialog Box
Use the **Messages** tab to select which message types to list in [Messages View](../vs140/Messages-View.md), and to specify message search criteria. To display the [Message Options Dialog Box](../vs140/Message-Options-Dialog-Box.md), choose **Log Messages** from the **Spy** menu.  
  
 Typically, you first select **Message Groups**, and then fine-tune the selection by selecting individual **Messages to View**. The **All** button selects all message types, and the **None** button clears all types.  
  
 The following settings are available on the **Messages** tab:  
  
 **Messages to View**  
 Select specific messages for viewing. When you create a new Messages window, it can display all messages. When you filter messages from the **Messages** tab, that filter only applies to new messages, not messages that have already been displayed in the Windows view.  
  
 **Message Groups**  
 Select message groups for viewing. The available groups include:  
  
-   WM_USER: with a code greater than or equal to WM_USER  
  
-   Registered: registered with the **RegisterWindowMessage** call  
  
-   Unknown: unknown messages in the range 0 to (WM_USER â€“ 1)  
  
 Note that these **Message Groups** do not map to specific entries under **Messages To View**. When you select a group, the selection is applied directly to the message stream.  
  
 A grayed check box within **Message Groups** indicates that the **Messages To View** list box has been modified for messages in that group; not all of the message types in that group are selected.  
  
 **Save Settings as Default**  
 Save the current settings for later use as message search options. These settings are also saved when exiting Spy++.
