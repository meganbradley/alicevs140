# hash_map::find
> [!NOTE]
>  This API is obsolete. The alternative is [unordered_map Class](../vs140/unordered_map-Class.md).  
  
 Returns an iterator addressing the location of an element in a hash_map that has a key equivalent to a specified key.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      iterator find(  
   const Key& _Key  
);  
const_iterator find(  
   const Key& _Key  
) const;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Key`  
 The key value to be matched by the sort key of an element from the hash_map being searched.  
  
## Return Value  
 An iterator that addresses the location of an element with a specified key, or the location succeeding the last element in the hash_map if no match is found for the key.  
  
## Remarks  
 **find** returns an iterator that addresses an element in the hash_map whose sort key is equivalent to the argument key under a binary predicate that induces an ordering based on a less than comparability relation.  
  
 If the return value of **find** is assigned to a [const_iterator](../vs140/hash_map--const_iterator.md), the hash_map object cannot be modified. If the return value of **find** is assigned to an [iterator](../vs140/hash_map--iterator.md), the hash_map object can be modified  
  
 In Visual C++ .NET 2003, members of the [<hash_map>](../vs140/-hash_map-.md) and [<hash_set>](../vs140/-hash_set-.md) header files are no longer in the std namespace, but rather have been moved into the stdext namespace. See [The stdext Namespace](../vs140/stdext-Namespace.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// hash_map_find.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <hash_map>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
   using namespace stdext;  
   hash_map <int, int> hm1;  
   hash_map <int, int> :: const_iterator hm1_AcIter, hm1_RcIter;  
   typedef pair <int, int> Int_Pair;  
  
   hm1.insert ( Int_Pair ( 1, 10 ) );  
   hm1.insert ( Int_Pair ( 2, 20 ) );  
   hm1.insert ( Int_Pair ( 3, 30 ) );  
  
   hm1_RcIter = hm1.find( 2 );  
   cout << "The element of hash_map hm1 with a key of 2 is: "  
        << hm1_RcIter -> second << "." << endl;  
  
   // If no match is found for the key, end( ) is returned  
   hm1_RcIter = hm1.find( 4 );  
  
   if ( hm1_RcIter == hm1.end( ) )  
      cout << "The hash_map hm1 doesn't have an element "  
           << "with a key of 4." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The element of hash_map hm1 with a key of 4 is: "  
           << hm1_RcIter -> second << "." << endl;  
  
   // The element at a specific location in the hash_map can be found   
   // using a dereferenced iterator addressing the location  
   hm1_AcIter = hm1.end( );  
   hm1_AcIter--;  
   hm1_RcIter = hm1.find( hm1_AcIter -> first );  
   cout << "The element of hm1 with a key matching "  
        << "that of the last element is: "  
        << hm1_RcIter -> second << "." << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The element of hash_map hm1 with a key of 2 is: 20.**  
**The hash_map hm1 doesn't have an element with a key of 4.**  
**The element of hm1 with a key matching that of the last element is: 30.**   
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <hash_map>  
  
 **Namespace:** stdext
