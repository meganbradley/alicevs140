# CWorkerThread Class
This class creates a worker thread or uses an existing one, waits on one or more kernel object handles, and executes a specified client function when one of the handles is signaled.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
template <  
   class  ThreadTraits  
   = DefaultThreadTraits>  
   class CWorkerThread  
  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `ThreadTraits`  
 The class providing the thread creation function, such as [CRTThreadTraits](../vs140/CRTThreadTraits-Class.md) or [Win32ThreadTraits](../vs140/Win32ThreadTraits-Class.md).

## Remarks  
  
### To use CWorkerThread  
  
1.  Create an instance of this class.  
  
2.  Call [CWorkerThread::Initialize](../vs140/CWorkerThread--Initialize.md).  
  
3.  Call [CWorkerThread::AddHandle](../vs140/CWorkerThread--AddHandle.md) with the handle of a kernel object and a pointer to an implementation of [IWorkerThreadClient](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient-Interface.md).  
  
     – or –  
  
     Call [CWorkerThread::AddTimer](../vs140/CWorkerThread--AddTimer.md) with a pointer to an implementation of [IWorkerThreadClient](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient-Interface.md).  
  
4.  Implement [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient--Execute.md) to take some action when the handle or timer is signaled.  
  
5.  To remove an object from the list of waitable objects, call [CWorkerThread::RemoveHandle](../vs140/CWorkerThread--RemoveHandle.md).  
  
6.  To terminate the thread, call [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](../vs140/CWorkerThread--Shutdown.md).  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlutil.h  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__addhandle"></a>  CWorkerThread::AddHandle  
 Call this method to add a waitable object's handle to the list maintained by the worker thread.  
  
```  
  
HRESULT AddHandle(  
      HANDLE  hObject,  
      IWorkerThreadClient*  pClient,  
      DWORD_PTR  dwParam  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `hObject`  
 The handle to a waitable object.  
  
 `pClient`  
 The pointer to the [IWorkerThreadClient](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient-Interface.md) interface on the object to be called when the handle is signaled.  
  
 `dwParam`  
 The parameter to be passed to [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient--Execute.md) when the handle is signaled.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient--Execute.md) will be called through `pClient` when the handle, `hObject`, is signaled.  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__addtimer"></a>  CWorkerThread::AddTimer  
 Call this method to add a periodic waitable timer to the list maintained by the worker thread.  
  
```  
  
HRESULT AddTimer(  
      DWORD  dwInterval,  
      IWorkerThreadClient*  pClient,  
      DWORD_PTR  dwParam,  
      HANDLE*  phTimer  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *dwInterval*  
 Specifies the period of the timer in milliseconds.  
  
 `pClient`  
 The pointer to the [IWorkerThreadClient](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient-Interface.md) interface on the object to be called when the handle is signaled.  
  
 `dwParam`  
 The parameter to be passed to [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient--Execute.md) when the handle is signaled.  
  
 `phTimer`  
 [out] Address of the HANDLE variable that, on success, receives the handle to the newly created timer.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 [IWorkerThreadClient::Execute](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient--Execute.md) will be called through `pClient` when the timer is signaled.  
  
 Pass the timer handle from `phTimer` to [CWorkerThread::RemoveHandle](../vs140/CWorkerThread--RemoveHandle.md) to close the timer.  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__cworkerthread"></a>  CWorkerThread::CWorkerThread  
 The constructor.  
  
```  
  
CWorkerThread( ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread___dtorcworkerthread"></a>  CWorkerThread::~CWorkerThread  
 The destructor.  
  
```  
  
~CWorkerThread( ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Calls [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](../vs140/CWorkerThread--Shutdown.md).  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__getthreadhandle"></a>  CWorkerThread::GetThreadHandle  
 Call this method to get the thread handle of the worker thread.  
  
```  
  
HANDLE GetThreadHandle( ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the thread handle or NULL if the worker thread has not been initialized.  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__getthreadid"></a>  CWorkerThread::GetThreadId  
 Call this method to get the thread ID of the worker thread.  
  
```  
  
DWORD GetThreadId( ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the thread ID or NULL if the worker thread has not been initialized.  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__initialize"></a>  CWorkerThread::Initialize  
 Call this method to initialize the worker thread.  
  
```  
  
HRESULT Initialize( ) throw( );   
   HRESULT Initialize(  
      CWorkerThread< ThreadTraits > *  pThread  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `pThread`  
 An existing worker thread.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method should be called to initialize the object after creation or after a call to [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](../vs140/CWorkerThread--Shutdown.md).  
  
 To have two or more `CWorkerThread` objects use the same worker thread, initialize one of them without passing any arguments then pass a pointer to that object to the `Initialize` methods of the others. The objects initialized using the pointer should be shut down before the object used to initialize them.  
  
 See [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](../vs140/CWorkerThread--Shutdown.md) for information on how that method's behavior changes when initialized using a pointer to an existing object.  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__removehandle"></a>  CWorkerThread::RemoveHandle  
 Call this method to remove a handle from the list of waitable objects.  
  
```  
  
HRESULT RemoveHandle(  
      HANDLE  hObject  
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `hObject`  
 The handle to remove.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 When the handle is removed [IWorkerThreadClient::CloseHandle](../vs140/IWorkerThreadClient--CloseHandle.md) will be called on the associated object that was passed to [AddHandle](../vs140/CWorkerThread--AddHandle.md). If this call fails, `CWorkerThread` will call the Windows [CloseHandle](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms724211) function on the handle.  
  
##  <a name="cworkerthread__shutdown"></a>  CWorkerThread::Shutdown  
 Call this method to shut down the worker thread.  
  
```  
  
HRESULT Shutdown(  
      DWORD  dwWait  
    = ATL_WORKER_THREAD_WAIT   
   ) throw( );  
  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `dwWait`  
 The time in milliseconds to wait for the worker thread to shut down.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure, such as if the timeout value, `dwWait`, is exceeded.  
  
### Remarks  
 To reuse the object, call [CWorkerThread::Initialize](../vs140/CWorkerThread--Initialize.md) after calling this method.  
  
 Note that calling **Shutdown** on an object initialized with a pointer to another `CWorkerThread` object has no effect and always returns S_OK.
