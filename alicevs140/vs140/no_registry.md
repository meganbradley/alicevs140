# no_registry
`no_registry` tells the compiler not to search the registry for type libraries imported with `#import`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
#import filename no_registry  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *filename*  
 A type library.  
  
## Remarks  
 If a referenced type library is not found in the include directories, the compilation will fail even if the type library is in the registry.  `no_registry` propagates to other type libraries implicitly imported with `auto_search`.  
  
 The compiler will never search the registry for type libraries that are specified by file name and passed directly to `#import`.  
  
 When `auto_search` is specified, the additional `#import`s will be generated with the `no_registry` setting of the initial `#import` (if the initial `#import` directive was `no_registry`, an `auto_search`-generated `#import` is also `no_registry`.)  
  
 `no_registry` is useful if you want to import cross referenced type libraries without the risk of the compiler finding an older version of the file in the registry.  `no_registry` is also useful if the type library is not registered.
