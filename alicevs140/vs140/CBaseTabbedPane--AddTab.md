# CBaseTabbedPane::AddTab
Adds a new tab to a tabbed pane.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual BOOL AddTab(  
    CWnd* pNewBar,  
    BOOL bVisible = TRUE,  
    BOOL bSetActive = TRUE,  
    BOOL bDetachable = TRUE  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [in] [out] `pNewBar`  
 A pointer to the pane to add. This pointer may become invalid after you call this method. For more information, see the Remarks section.  
  
 [in] `bVisible`  
 `TRUE` to make the tab visible; otherwise, `FALSE`.  
  
 [in] `bSetActive`  
 `TRUE` to make the tab the active tab; otherwise, `FALSE`.  
  
 [in] `bDetachable`  
 `TRUE` to make the tab detachable; otherwise, `FALSE`.  
  
## Return Value  
 `TRUE` if the pane was successfully added as a tab and was not destroyed in the process. `FALSE` if the pane being added is an object of type `CBaseTabbedPane`. For more information, see the Remarks section.  
  
## Remarks  
 Call this method to add a pane as a new tab on a tabbed pane. If `pNewBar` points to an object of type `CBaseTabbedPane`, all its tabs are copied onto the tabbed pane and then `pNewBar` is destroyed. Thus, `pNewBar` becomes an invalid pointer and should not be used.
