# Date and Time: Database Support
As of version 4.0, MFC database programming uses the [COleDateTime](../vs140/COleDateTime-Class.md) and [COleDateTimeSpan](../vs140/COleDateTimeSpan-Class.md) classes to represent date and time data. These classes, also used in Automation, are derived from class [COleVariant](../vs140/COleVariant-Class.md). They supply better support for managing date and time data than do [CTime](../Topic/CTime%20Class.md) and [CTimeSpan](../vs140/CTimeSpan-Class.md).
