# Cannot find component &#39;file&#39; of multifile assembly &#39;assembly&#39;
One file in a multifile assembly could not be found. A multifile assembly references one or more files, such as modules or resource files.  
  
 The assembly being copied could be a direct reference, visible in the **References** node in Solution Explorer, or it could be an assembly that is a dependency of a direct reference.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Reinstall the component.  
  
     The project may build, but it might not run.
