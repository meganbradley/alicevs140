# CWnd::OnMouseMove
The framework calls this member function when the mouse cursor moves.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnMouseMove(  
   UINT nFlags,  
   CPoint point   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nFlags`  
 Indicates whether various virtual keys are down. This parameter can be any combination of the following values:  
  
-   **MK_CONTROL** Set if the CTRL key is down.  
  
-   **MK_LBUTTON** Set if the left mouse button is down.  
  
-   **MK_MBUTTON** Set if the middle mouse button is down.  
  
-   **MK_RBUTTON** Set if the right mouse button is down.  
  
-   **MK_SHIFT** Set if the SHIFT key is down.  
  
 `point`  
 Specifies the x- and y-coordinate of the cursor. These coordinates are always relative to the upper-left corner of the window.  
  
## Remarks  
 If the mouse is not captured, the `WM_MOUSEMOVE` message is received by the `CWnd` object beneath the mouse cursor; otherwise, the message goes to the window that has captured the mouse.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
