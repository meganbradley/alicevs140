# CDC::Chord
Draws a chord (a closed figure bounded by the intersection of an ellipse and a line segment).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      BOOL Chord(  
   int x1,  
   int y1,  
   int x2,  
   int y2,  
   int x3,  
   int y3,  
   int x4,  
   int y4   
);  
BOOL Chord(  
   LPCRECT lpRect,  
   POINT ptStart,  
   POINT ptEnd   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `x1`  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the chord's bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 `y1`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the chord's bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 `x2`  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the lower-right corner of the chord's bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 `y2`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the lower-right corner of the chord's bounding rectangle (in logical units).  
  
 *x3*  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the point that defines the chord's starting point (in logical units).  
  
 `y3`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the point that defines the chord's starting point (in logical units).  
  
 `x4`  
 Specifies the x-coordinate of the point that defines the chord's endpoint (in logical units).  
  
 `y4`  
 Specifies the y-coordinate of the point that defines the chord's endpoint (in logical units).  
  
 `lpRect`  
 Specifies the bounding rectangle (in logical units). You can pass either a `LPRECT` or a [CRect](../vs140/CRect-Class.md) object for this parameter.  
  
 `ptStart`  
 Specifies the x- and y-coordinates of the point that defines the chord's starting point (in logical units). This point does not have to lie exactly on the chord. You can pass either a **POINT** structure or a `CPoint` object for this parameter.  
  
 `ptEnd`  
 Specifies the x- and y-coordinates of the point that defines the chord's ending point (in logical units). This point does not have to lie exactly on the chord. You can pass either a [POINT](../vs140/POINT-Structure.md) structure or a [CPoint](../vs140/CPoint-Class.md) object for this parameter.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if the function is successful; otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) parameters specify the upper-left and lower-right corners, respectively, of a rectangle bounding the ellipse that is part of the chord. The (*x3*, `y3`) and (`x4`, `y4`) parameters specify the endpoints of a line that intersects the ellipse. The chord is drawn by using the selected pen and filled by using the selected brush.  
  
 The figure drawn by the `Chord` function extends up to, but does not include the right and bottom coordinates. This means that the height of the figure is `y2` – `y1` and the width of the figure is `x2` – `x1`.
