# Error creating assembly manifest: &lt;error message&gt;
The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest. The linker has reported an error in the pre-emission stage of creating the assembly.  
  
 This can occur if there are problems with the key file or the key container specified. To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys. To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information. The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed. For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly (Visual Studio)](assetId:///f468a7d3-234c-4353-924d-8e0ae5896564).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30140
