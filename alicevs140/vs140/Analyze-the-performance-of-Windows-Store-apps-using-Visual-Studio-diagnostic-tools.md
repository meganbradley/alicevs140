# Analyze the performance of Windows Store apps using Visual Studio diagnostic tools
By showing you where the code of your Store app spends its time as your program executes, the Visual Studio profilers can help you find the performance bottlenecks in your apps, functions, and algorithms.  
  
## In This Section  
  
### Analyze CPU Usage
