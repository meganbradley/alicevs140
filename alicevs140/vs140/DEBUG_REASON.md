# DEBUG_REASON
Specifies why the process was launched for debugging.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
enum enum_DEBUG_REASON {  
   DEBUG_REASON_ERROR         = 0,  
   DEBUG_REASON_USER_LAUNCHED = 1,  
   DEBUG_REASON_USER_ATTACHED = 2,  
   DEBUG_REASON_AUTO_ATTACHED = 3,  
   DEBUG_REASON_CAUSALITY     = 4  
};  
typedef DWORD DEBUG_REASON;  
```  
  
```c#  
public enum enum_DEBUG_REASON {  
   DEBUG_REASON_ERROR         = 0,  
   DEBUG_REASON_USER_LAUNCHED = 1,  
   DEBUG_REASON_USER_ATTACHED = 2,  
   DEBUG_REASON_AUTO_ATTACHED = 3,  
   DEBUG_REASON_CAUSALITY     = 4  
};  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 DEBUG_REASON_ERROR  
 A non-specific error occurred (this is used as a default condition when none of the other reasons fit).  
  
 DEBUG_REASON_USER_LAUNCHED  
 The process was launched at the user's request.  
  
 DEBUG_REASON_USER_ATTACHED  
 The already-running process was attached to by the user.  
  
 DEBUG_REASON_AUTO_ATTACHED  
 The process was automatically attached to when it was launched.  
  
 DEBUG_REASON_CAUSALITY  
 The process was launched due to a *Just-In-Time* (JIT) debugging event.
