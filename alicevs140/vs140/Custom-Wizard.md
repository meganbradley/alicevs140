# Custom Wizard
The Visual C++ Custom Wizard is a specific type of wizard, designed to help you create your own wizards. Once configured, your wizard generates the starter files you need for your projects.  
  
## Overview  
 This wizard page describes the current application settings for the Custom Wizard project you are creating. By default, the wizard creates a project as follows:  
  
-   The wizard's friendly name is set to the name of the project you indicated in the **New Project dialog box**.  
  
-   The wizard has a user interface.  
  
-   The wizard user interface has one page.  
  
 You can change these default settings on the [Application Settings](../vs140/Application-Settings--Custom-Wizard.md) page of the wizard.
