# How to: Set a Summary Property for a LightSwitch Application
By setting the summary property, you can choose which field from a table appears on Browse or List screens. If your application contains multiple clients, you can set a different summary property for each client.  
  
### To set the summary property  
  
1.  In the Data Designer, on the **Perspective** bar, choose the **DesktopClient** or **HTMLClient** tab.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, in the **Summary Property** list, choose the field to display.
