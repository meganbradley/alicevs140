# How to: Create an HTML Client Screen
Create a screen or set of screens to display or collect information on a mobile device.

1.  In **Solution Explorer**, choose the **HTML Client** project node.  
  
2.  On the menu bar, choose **Project**, **Add Screen**.  
  
     The **Add New Screen** dialog box appears.  
  
3.  Under **Select a screen template**, choose the type of screen that you want to create.  
  
     For more information, see [Choosing  an HTML Client Screen Type](../vs140/Choosing-a-Screen-Type-for-an-HTML-Client-of-a-LightSwitch-App.md).

5.  In the **Screen Data** list, choose the entity or query that will specify what data appears on the screen.
