# fread
Reads data from a stream.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_t fread(   
   void *buffer,  
   size_t size,  
   size_t count,  
   FILE *stream   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `buffer`  
 Storage location for data.  
  
 `size`  
 Item size in bytes.  
  
 `count`  
 Maximum number of items to be read.  
  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to `FILE` structure.  
  
## Return Value  
 `fread` returns the number of full items actually read, which may be less than `count` if an error occurs or if the end of the file is encountered before reaching `count`*.* Use the `feof` or `ferror` function to distinguish a read error from an end-of-file condition. If `size` or `count` is 0, `fread` returns 0 and the buffer contents are unchanged. If `stream` or `buffer` is a null pointer, `fread` invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../vs140/Parameter-Validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns 0.  
  
 See [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../vs140/errno--_doserrno--_sys_errlist--and-_sys_nerr.md) for more information on these, and other, error codes.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `fread` function reads up to `count` items of `size` bytes from the input `stream` and stores them in `buffer`*.* The file pointer associated with `stream` (if there is one) is increased by the number of bytes actually read. If the given stream is opened in text mode, carriage returnâ€“linefeed pairs are replaced with single linefeed characters. The replacement has no effect on the file pointer or the return value. The file-pointer position is indeterminate if an error occurs. The value of a partially read item cannot be determined.  
  
 This function locks out other threads. If you need a non-locking version, use `_fread_nolock`.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Function|Required header|

## Example  
  
```  
// crt_fread.c  
// This program opens a file named FREAD.OUT and  
// writes 25 characters to the file. It then tries to open  
// FREAD.OUT and read in 25 characters. If the attempt succeeds,  
// the program displays the number of actual items read.  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   FILE *stream;  
   char list[30];  
   int  i, numread, numwritten;  
  
   // Open file in text mode:  
   if( fopen_s( &stream, "fread.out", "w+t" ) == 0 )  
   {  
      for ( i = 0; i < 25; i++ )  
         list[i] = (char)('z' - i);  
      // Write 25 characters to stream   
      numwritten = fwrite( list, sizeof( char ), 25, stream );  
      printf( "Wrote %d items\n", numwritten );  
      fclose( stream );  
  
   }  
   else  
      printf( "Problem opening the file\n" );  
  
   if( fopen_s( &stream, "fread.out", "r+t" ) == 0 )  
   {  
      // Attempt to read in 25 characters   
      numread = fread( list, sizeof( char ), 25, stream );  
      printf( "Number of items read = %d\n", numread );  
      printf( "Contents of buffer = %.25s\n", list );  
      fclose( stream );  
   }  
   else  
      printf( "File could not be opened\n" );  
}  
```  
  
 **Wrote 25 items**  
**Number of items read = 25**  
**Contents of buffer = zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcb**
