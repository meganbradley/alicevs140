# CMemFile::Attach
Call this function to attach a block of memory to `CMemFile`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void Attach(  
   BYTE* lpBuffer,  
   UINT nBufferSize,  
   UINT nGrowBytes = 0   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpBuffer`  
 Pointer to the buffer to be attached to `CMemFile`.  
  
 `nBufferSize`  
 An integer that specifies the size of the buffer in bytes.  
  
 `nGrowBytes`  
 The memory allocation increment in bytes.  
  
## Remarks  
 This causes `CMemFile` to use the block of memory as the memory file.  
  
 If `nGrowBytes` is 0, `CMemFile` will set the file length to `nBufferSize`. This means that the data in the memory block before it was attached to `CMemFile` will be used as the file. Memory files created in this manner cannot be grown.  
  
 Since the file cannot be grown, be careful not to cause `CMemFile` to attempt to grow the file. For example, don't call the `CMemFile` overrides of [CFile:Write](../vs140/CFile--Write.md) to write past the end or don't call [CFile:SetLength](../vs140/CFile--SetLength.md) with a length longer than `nBufferSize`.  
  
 If `nGrowBytes` is greater than 0, `CMemFile` will ignore the contents of the memory block you've attached. You'll have to write the contents of the memory file from scratch using the `CMemFile` override of `CFile::Write`. If you attempt to write past the end of the file or grow the file by calling the `CMemFile` override of `CFile::SetLength`, `CMemFile` will grow the memory allocation in increments of `nGrowBytes`. Growing the memory allocation will fail if the memory block you pass to **Attach** wasn't allocated with a method compatible with [Alloc](../vs140/CMemFile--Alloc.md). To be compatible with the default implementation of `Alloc`, you must allocate the memory with the run-time library function [malloc](../vs140/malloc.md) or [calloc](../vs140/calloc.md).
