# Windows
This family of articles covers window objects in the MFC framework. All MFC windows derive from class [CWnd](../vs140/CWnd-Class.md), including frame windows, views, dialog boxes, and controls.  
  
 The first group of articles describes [window objects](../vs140/Window-Objects.md) in general. Refer to this group for general information about C++ window objects, how they encapsulate an HWND, and how you use them when creating your own windows, such as child windows.  
  
 The second group of articles describes [frame windows](../vs140/Frame-Windows.md)—windows that put a frame around content — in particular. Refer to this group for information about how the MFC framework manages frame windows and the contents that they frame, including control bars and views.
