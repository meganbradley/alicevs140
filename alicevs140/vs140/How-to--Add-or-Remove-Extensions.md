You can find and download extensions directly from [!INCLUDE[smb_current_short](../vs140/includes/smb_current_short_md.md)] by using the **Extension Manager**. After the download finishes, the extensions appear in the **Extensions** tab of the **Application Designer**. You can enable or disable them as needed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Extensions are only available in Silverlight client projects.
