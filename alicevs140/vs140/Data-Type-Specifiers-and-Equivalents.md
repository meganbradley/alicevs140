# Data Type Specifiers and Equivalents
This book generally uses the forms of the type specifiers listed in the following table rather than the long forms, and it assumes that the `char` type is signed by default. Therefore, throughout this book, `char` is equivalent to **signed char**.  
  
### Type Specifiers and Equivalents  
  
|Type Specifier|Equivalent(s)|  
|--------------------|---------------------|  
|**signed char**1|`char`|  
|**signed int**|**signed**, `int`|  
|**signed short int**|**short**, `signed short`|  
|**signed long int**|**long**, **signed long**|  
|`unsigned char`|—|  
|`unsigned int`|`unsigned`|  
|**unsigned short int**|**unsigned short**|  
|**unsigned long int**|`unsigned long`|  
|**float**|—|  
|`long double`2|—|  
  
 1   When you make the `char` type unsigned by default (by specifying the /J compiler option), you cannot abbreviate **signed char** as `char`.  
  
 2   In 32-bit operating systems, the Microsoft C compiler maps **long double** to type **double**.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 You can specify the /J compiler option to change the default `char` type from signed to unsigned. When this option is in effect, `char` means the same as `unsigned char`, and you must use the **signed** keyword to declare a signed character value. If a `char` value is explicitly declared signed, the /J option does not affect it, and the value is sign-extended when widened to an `int` type. The `char` type is zero-extended when widened to `int` type.
