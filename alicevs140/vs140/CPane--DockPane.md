# CPane::DockPane
Docks the floating pane to a base pane.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual BOOL DockPane(  
    CBasePane* pDockBar,  
    LPCRECT lpRect,  
    AFX_DOCK_METHOD dockMethod  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [in] [out] `pDockBar`  
 Specifies the base pane to dock this pane to.  
  
 [in] `lpRect`  
 Specifies the rectangle on the base pane where this pane is to be docked.  
  
 [in] `dockMethod`  
 Specifies the docking method to use. Available options are as follows:  
  
|Option|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`DM_UNKNOWN`|The framework uses this option when the docking method is unknown. The pane does not store its most recent floating position. You can also use this option to programmatically dock a pane when you do not have to store the recent floating position.|  
|`DM_MOUSE`|Used internally.|  
|`DM_DBL_CLICK`|This option is used when the gripper is double-clicked. The pane is repositioned at its most recent docking position. If the pane is undocked by double-clicking, the pane is repositioned at its most recent floating position.|  
|`DM_SHOW`|This option can be used to programmatically dock the pane. The pane stores its most recent floating position.|  
|`DM_RECT`|The pane is docked in the region that is specified by `lpRect`.|  
|`DM_STANDARD`|When you use this option, the framework draws the pane as an outline frame while it is being moved.|  
  
## Return Value  
 `TRUE` if the pane was docked successfully; otherwise, `FALSE`.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method docks the pane to the base pane that is specified by the `pDockBar` parameter. You must first enable docking by calling [CBasePane::EnableDocking](../vs140/CBasePane--EnableDocking.md).
