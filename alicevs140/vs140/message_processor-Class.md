# message_processor Class
The             `message_processor` class is the abstract base class for processing of             `message` objects. There is no guarantee on the ordering of the messages.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<  
   class             _Type  
>  
class message_processor;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Type`  
 The data type of the payload within messages handled by this                         `message_processor` object.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Typedefs  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`type`|A type alias for                                         `_Type`.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[message_processor::async_send Method](#message_processor__async_send_method)|When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block asynchronously.|  
|[message_processor::sync_send Method](#message_processor__sync_send_method)|When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block synchronously.|  
|[message_processor::wait Method](#message_processor__wait_method)|When overridden in a derived class, waits for all asynchronous operations to complete.|  
  
### Protected Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[message_processor::process_incoming_message Method](#message_processor__process_incoming_message_method)|When overridden in a derived class, performs the forward processing of messages into the block. Called once every time a new message is added and the queue is found to be empty.|  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `message_processor`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="message_processor__async_send_method"></a>  message_processor::async_send Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block asynchronously.  
  
```  
virtual void async_send(  
   _Inout_opt_ message<_Type> *                 _Msg  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Msg`  
 A                                 `message` object to send asynchronously.  
  
### Remarks  
 Processor implementations should override this method.  
  
##  <a name="message_processor__process_incoming_message_method"></a>  message_processor::process_incoming_message Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, performs the forward processing of messages into the block. Called once every time a new message is added and the queue is found to be empty.  
  
```  
virtual void process_incoming_message() = 0;  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Message block implementations should override this method.  
  
##  <a name="message_processor__sync_send_method"></a>  message_processor::sync_send Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block synchronously.  
  
```  
virtual void sync_send(  
   _Inout_opt_ message<_Type> *                 _Msg  
) = 0;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Msg`  
 A                                 `message` object to send synchronously.  
  
### Remarks  
 Processor implementations should override this method.  
  
##  <a name="message_processor__wait_method"></a>  message_processor::wait Method  
 When overridden in a derived class, waits for all asynchronous operations to complete.  
  
```  
virtual void wait() = 0;  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Processor implementations should override this method.
