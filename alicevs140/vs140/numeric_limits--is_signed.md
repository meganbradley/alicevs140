# numeric_limits::is_signed
Tests if a type has a signed representation.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
static const bool is_signed = false;  
  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 **true** if the type has a signed representation; **false** if not.  
  
## Remarks  
 The member stores true for a type that has a signed representation, which is the case for all predefined floating-point and signed integer types.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// numeric_limits_is_signaled.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <iostream>  
#include <limits>  
  
using namespace std;  
  
int main( )  
{  
   cout << "Whether float objects have a signed representation: "  
        << numeric_limits<float>::is_signed  
        << endl;  
   cout << "Whether double objects have a signed representation: "  
        << numeric_limits<double>::is_signed  
        << endl;  
   cout << "Whether signed char objects have a signed representation: "  
        << numeric_limits<signed char>::is_signed  
        << endl;  
   cout << "Whether unsigned char objects have a signed representation: "  
        << numeric_limits<unsigned char>::is_signed  
        << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **Whether float objects have a signed representation: 1**  
**Whether double objects have a signed representation: 1**  
**Whether signed char objects have a signed representation: 1**  
**Whether unsigned char objects have a signed representation: 0**   
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <limits\>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
