# _aligned_msize_dbg
Returns the size of a memory block allocated in the heap (debug version only).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_t _aligned_msize_dbg(  
   void *memblock,  
   size_t alignment,  
   size_t offset  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [in] `memblock`  
 Pointer to the memory block.  
  
 [in] `alignment`  
 The alignment value, which must be an integer power of 2.  
  
 [in] `offset`  
 The offset into the memory allocation to force the alignment.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns the size (in bytes) as an unsigned integer.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `alignment` and `offset` values must be the same as the values passed to the function that allocated the block.  
  
 `_aligned_msize_dbg` is a debug version of the [_aligned_msize](../vs140/_aligned_msize.md) function. When [_DEBUG](../vs140/_DEBUG.md) is not defined, each call to `_aligned_msize_dbg` is reduced to a call to `_aligned_msize`. Both `_aligned_msize` and `_aligned_msize_dbg` calculate the size of a memory block in the base heap, but `_aligned_msize_dbg` adds a debugging feature: It includes the buffers on either side of the user portion of the memory block in the returned size.  
  
 This function validates its parameter. If `memblock` is a null pointer or `alignment` is not a power of 2, `_msize` invokes an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../vs140/Parameter-Validation.md). If the error is handled, the function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns -1.  
  
 For information about how memory blocks are allocated, initialized, and managed in the debug version of the base heap, see [CRT Debug Heap Details](../vs140/CRT-Debug-Heap-Details.md). For information about the allocation block types and how they are used, see [Types of blocks on the debug heap](../vs140/CRT-Debug-Heap-Details.md#BKMK_Types_of_blocks_on_the_debug_heap). For information about the differences between calling a standard heap function and its debug version in a debug build of an application, see [Debug Versions of Heap Allocation Functions](../vs140/Debug-Versions-of-Heap-Allocation-Functions.md).

 For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../vs140/Compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Libraries  
 Debug versions of [C run-time libraries](../vs140/CRT-Library-Features.md) only.  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](assetId:///15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
