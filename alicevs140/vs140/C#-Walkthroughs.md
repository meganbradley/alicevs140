# C# Walkthroughs
Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 This section contains links to C# programming walkthroughs.

 [Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](../vs140/Walkthrough--Accessing-the-Web-by-Using-Async-and-Await--C#-and-Visual-Basic-.md)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [async](../Topic/async%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md) and [await](../Topic/await%20\(C%23%20Reference\).md), introduced in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../vs140/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)].  
  
 [Creating a Windows Runtime Component in C# or Visual Basic and Calling it from JavaScript](assetId:///fc3ed156-ca29-42f3-ad60-acb228812633)  
 Shows how to create a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../vs140/includes/wrt_md.md)] type, package it in a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../vs140/includes/wrt_md.md)] component, and then call the component from a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app that's built for Windows by using JavaScript.  
  
 [Office Programming (C# and Visual Basic)](../vs140/Walkthrough--Office-Programming--C#-and-Visual-Basic-.md)  
 Shows how to create an Excel workbook and a Word document by using C# and Visual Basic.  
  
 [Creating and Using Dynamic Objects (C# and Visual Basic)](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Creating%20and%20Using%20Dynamic%20Objects%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Shows how to create a custom object that dynamically exposes the contents of a text file, and how to create a project that uses the `IronPython` library.  
  
 [Authoring a Component with Visual C#](assetId:///e7a5405d-ab47-4578-bcbf-38f6cf7ccfac)  
 Shows the development of a simple component, illustrating the interaction between client and component, object lifetime and circular references, debugging clients and components, and the use of shared methods and instance methods.  
  
 [Authoring a Composite Control with Visual C#](assetId:///f88481a8-c746-4a36-9479-374ce5f2e91f)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple composite control and extending its functionality through inheritance.  
  
 [Authoring a Simple Multithreaded Component with Visual C#](assetId:///7bc03b7b-d680-499b-8179-5f414b2d650c)  
 Demonstrates creating a multithreaded component, explaining how threads work and how to coordinate multiple threads in your component.  
  
 [Creating a Windows Forms Control that Takes Advantage of Visual Studio Design-Time Features](assetId:///6f487c59-cb38-4afa-ad2e-95edacb1d626)  
 Illustrates how to create a custom designer for a custom control.  
  
 [Inheriting from a Windows Forms Control with Visual C#](assetId:///09476da0-8d4c-4a4c-b969-649519dfb438)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple inherited button control. This button inherits functionality from the standard Windows Forms button and exposes a custom member.  
  
 [Debugging Custom Windows Forms Controls at Design Time](assetId:///1fd83ccd-3798-42fc-85a3-6cba99467387)  
 Describes how to debug the design-time behavior of your custom control.  
  
 [Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls](assetId:///cac337e6-00f6-4584-80f4-75728f5ea113)  
 Demonstrates some of the commonly performed tasks such as adding or removing a tab on a `TabControl`, docking a control to its parent, and changing the orientation of a `SplitContainer` control.  
  
 [Writing Queries in C# (LINQ)](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Writing%20Queries%20in%20C%23%20\(LINQ\).md)  
 Demonstrates the C# language features that are used to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../vs140/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query expressions.  
  
 [Manipulating Data (C#) (LINQ to SQL)](assetId:///24adfbe0-0ad6-449f-997d-8808e0770d2e)  
 Describes a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../vs140/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] scenario for adding, modifying, and deleting data in a database.
