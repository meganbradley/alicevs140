# Windows Platforms (CRT)
The C run-time libraries for [!INCLUDE[vs2012_upd01](../vs140/includes/vs2012_upd01_md.md)] support [!INCLUDE[win8](../vs140/includes/win8_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winserver8](../vs140/includes/winserver8_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win7](../vs140/includes/win7_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winsvr08](../vs140/includes/winsvr08_md.md)], Windows Vista, [!INCLUDE[winxp](../vs140/includes/winxp_md.md)] Service Pack 3 (SP3) for x86, [!INCLUDE[winxp](../vs140/includes/winxp_md.md)] Service Pack 2 (SP2) for x64, and [!INCLUDE[WinXPSvr](../vs140/includes/winxpsvr_md.md)] Service Pack 2 (SP2) for both x86 and x64. All of these operating systems support the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) and provide Unicode support. In addition, any Win32 application can use a multibyte character set (MBCS).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../vs140/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] does not support [!INCLUDE[winxp](../vs140/includes/winxp_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[WinXPSvr](../vs140/includes/winxpsvr_md.md)] development. You must install [!INCLUDE[vs2012_upd01](../vs140/includes/vs2012_upd01_md.md)] to add support for [!INCLUDE[winxp](../vs140/includes/winxp_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[WinXPSvr](../vs140/includes/winxpsvr_md.md)].
