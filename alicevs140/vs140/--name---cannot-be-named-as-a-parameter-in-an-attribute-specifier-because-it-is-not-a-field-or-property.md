# &#39;&lt;name&gt;&#39; cannot be named as a parameter in an attribute specifier because it is not a field or property
An attribute block sets a value for a nonvariable member of the attribute. You can assign values only to variable members such as fields or properties.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32010  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the attribute and member names are spelled correctly.  
  
2.  Remove the argument from the attribute block if the member is nonvariable.
