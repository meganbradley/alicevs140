# Trackers: Implementing Trackers in Your OLE Application
Trackers provide a graphical interface to enable users to interact with OLE client items. By using different tracker styles, OLE client items can be displayed with hatched borders, resize handles, or a variety of other visual effects. This article describes:  
  
-   [How to Implement Tracking in Your Code](../vs140/How-to--Implement-Tracking-in-Your-Code.md).  
  
-   [Rubber-Banding and Trackers](../vs140/Rubber-Banding-and-Trackers.md).  
  
 The article also covers the use of styles with trackers. In addition, it makes several references to the MFC OLE sample [OCLIENT](../vs140/Visual-C---Samples.md).
