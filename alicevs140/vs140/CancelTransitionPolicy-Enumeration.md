# CancelTransitionPolicy Enumeration
Indicates how an asynchronous operationâ€™s attempt to transition to a terminal state of completed or error should behave with respect to a client-requested canceled state.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
enum CancelTransitionPolicy;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Values  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`RemainCanceled`|If the asynchronous operation is currently in a client-requested canceled state, this indicates that it will stay in the canceled state as opposed to transitioning to a terminal completed or error state.|  
|`TransitionFromCanceled`|If the asynchronous operation is currently in a client-requested canceled state, this indicates that state should transition from that canceled state to the terminal state of completed or error as determined by the call that utilizes this flag.|
