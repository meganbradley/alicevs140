# Resources for Creating a Game Using DirectX
To create the best desktop games, use Visual C++ and DirectX together.  
  
## Resources  
 Visual C++ is included in all editions of Visual Studio. For information about Visual Studio, see the [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) website.  
  
 For [!INCLUDE[win81](../vs140/includes/win81_md.md)], DirectX is included in the Windows SDK. You don't have to download anything extra. For more information, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee663275.aspx).  
  
 To create DirectX apps for Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, you can download the stand-alone [DirectX SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=6812).  
  
 [DirectX Graphics and Gaming](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee663274\(v=vs.85\).aspx) has information and samples to help you get started with DirectX programming.  
  
 [Win32 Windows Applications](../vs140/Windows-Desktop-Applications--C---.md) contains articles that describe how to create a basic Windows desktop app.  
  
 [Developing Games](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh452744.aspx) discusses [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] game development, but many of the concepts also apply to desktop games.
