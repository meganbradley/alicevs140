# CDC::AbortDoc
Terminates the current print job and erases everything the application has written to the device since the last call to the [StartDoc](../vs140/CDC--StartDoc.md) member function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
int AbortDoc( );  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 A value greater than or equal to 0 if successful, or a negative value if an error has occurred. The following list shows common error values and their meanings:  
  
-   **SP_ERROR** General error.  
  
-   **SP_OUTOFDISK** Not enough disk space is currently available for spooling, and no more space will become available.  
  
-   **SP_OUTOFMEMORY** Not enough memory is available for spooling.  
  
-   **SP_USERABORT** User terminated the job through the Print Manager.  
  
## Remarks  
 This member function replaces the `ABORTDOC` printer escape.  
  
 **AbortDoc** should be used to terminate the following:  
  
-   Printing operations that do not specify an abort function using [SetAbortProc](../vs140/CDC--SetAbortProc.md).  
  
-   Printing operations that have not yet reached their first **NEWFRAME** or **NEXTBAND** escape call.  
  
 If an application encounters a printing error or a canceled print operation, it must not attempt to terminate the operation by using either the [EndDoc](../vs140/CDC--EndDoc.md) or **AbortDoc** member functions of class `CDC`. GDI automatically terminates the operation before returning the error value.  
  
 If the application displays a dialog box to allow the user to cancel the print operation, it must call **AbortDoc** before destroying the dialog box.  
  
 If Print Manager was used to start the print job, calling **AbortDoc** erases the entire spool job â€” the printer receives nothing. If Print Manager was not used to start the print job, the data may have been sent to the printer before **AbortDoc** was called. In this case, the printer driver would have reset the printer (when possible) and closed the print job.  
  
## Example  
 See the example for [CDC::StartDoc](../vs140/CDC--StartDoc.md).
