# How to: Add Static Text or Images to a Screen
In addition to using the controls that are bound to data, you may also want to display static text and images. For example, you might want to display a company logo or provide instructions for filling out a form.  
  
### To add static text  
  
1.  In the screen designer, in the **Screen Content Tree**, choose the group where you want to add static text.  
  
2.  In the **Add** list, choose **New Static Label**.  
  
     The **Edit Text** dialog box appears.  
  
3.  Enter the text that you want to display, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  You can display multiple lines of text. Choose the Ctrl + Enter keys to start a line.  
  
4.  Drag the **Static Label** control to the appropriate location in the **Screen Content Tree**.  
  
5.  (Optional) In the **Properties** window, change the appearance of the text by choosing a style in the **Font Style** list.  
  
### To add a static image  
  
1.  In the screen designer, in the **Screen Content Tree**, choose the group where you want to add an image.  
  
2.  In the **Add** list, choose **New Static Image**.  
  
     The **Select Image** dialog box appears.  
  
3.  Choose an image that you have already added, or choose the **Import** button to browse to the location of an image file (.png or .jpg), and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
4.  Drag the **Static Image** control to the appropriate location in the **Screen Content Tree**.  
  
5.  (Optional) In the **Properties** window, change the appearance of the image by choosing a value in the **Stretch** list.  
  
6.  (Optional) In the **Properties** window, display a border around the image by selecting the **Show Border** check box.
