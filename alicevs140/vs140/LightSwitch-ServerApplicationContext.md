# LightSwitch ServerApplicationContext
The `ServerApplicationContext` API allows you to call custom business logic on the LightSwitch **Server** tier. Unlike accessing LightSwitch as an OData data source, the `ServerApplicationContext` API lets you accomplish tasks such as:  
  
-   Start a workflow or process on the LightSwitch **Server** tier from a client application.  
  
-   Retrieve non-entity data from the LightSwitch **Server** tier.  
  
-   Upload a file to the **Server** tier from a client application and store it in a remote location  
  
-   Create a standalone user interface (for example, an .aspx page) that reads and writes LightSwitch data.  
  
 The `ServerApplicationContext` can be called from within your own web service endpoints. You can add any of the normal ASP.NET web assets to your **Server** project and create new ways of interacting with the LightSwitch server. For example, you could create an ASP.NET Web Form, a WCF Service, or a Web API endpoint. You decide the appropriate way you'd like to expose a new service, using the normal Visual Studio gestures for adding and working with those assets.
