# const_mem_fun1_t Class
An adapter class that allows a **const** member function that takes a single argument to be called as a binary function object when initialized with a pointer argument.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<class Result, class Type, class Arg>  
   class const_mem_fun1_t  
      : public binary_function<const Type *, Arg, Result>   
   {  
   explicit const_mem_fun1_t( Result ( Type::* _Pm )( Arg ) const );  
   Result operator()(  
      const Type* _Pleft,   
      Arg _Right  
   ) const;  
   };  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Pm`  
 A pointer to the member function of class **Type** to be converted to a function object.  
  
 `_Pleft`  
 The **const** object that the `_Pm` member function is called on.  
  
 `_Right`  
 The argument that is being given to `_Pm`.  
  
## Return Value  
 An adaptable binary function.  
  
## Remarks  
 The template class stores a copy of `_Pm`, which must be a pointer to a member function of class **Type**, in a private member object. It defines its member function `operator()` as returning ( **_Pleft**->\*                 *Pm)(***Right**) **const**.  
  
## Example  
 The constructor of `const_mem_fun1_t` is not usually used directly; the helper function `mem_fun` is used to adapt member functions. See [mem_fun](../vs140/-functional--functions.md#mem_fun_function) for an example of how to use member function adaptors.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <functional\>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
