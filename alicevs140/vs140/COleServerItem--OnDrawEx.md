# COleServerItem::OnDrawEx
Called by the framework for all drawing.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual BOOL OnDrawEx(  
   CDC* pDC,  
   DVASPECT nDrawAspect,  
   CSize& rSize   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pDC`  
 A pointer to the [CDC](../vs140/CDC-Class.md) object on which to draw the item. The DC is automatically connected to the attribute DC so you can call attribute functions, although doing so would make the metafile device-specific.  
  
 `nDrawAspect`  
 A value from the `DVASPECT` enumeration. This parameter can have any of the following values:  
  
-   `DVASPECT_CONTENT` Item is represented in such a way that it can be displayed as an embedded object inside its container.  
  
-   `DVASPECT_THUMBNAIL` Item is rendered in a "thumbnail" representation so that it can be displayed in a browsing tool.  
  
-   `DVASPECT_ICON` Item is represented by an icon.  
  
-   `DVASPECT_DOCPRINT` Item is represented as if it were printed using the Print command from the File menu.  
  
 `rSize`  
 Size of the item in **HIMETRIC** units.  
  
## Return Value  
 Nonzero if the item was successfully drawn; otherwise 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The default implementation calls `OnDraw` when `DVASPECT` is equal to `DVASPECT_CONTENT`; otherwise it fails.  
  
 Override this function to provide presentation data for aspects other than `DVASPECT_CONTENT`, such as `DVASPECT_ICON` or `DVASPECT_THUMBNAIL`.
