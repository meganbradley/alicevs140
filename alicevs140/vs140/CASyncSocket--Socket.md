# CASyncSocket::Socket
Allocates a socket handle.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
BOOL Socket(  
   int nSocketType = SOCK_STREAM,  
   long lEvent = FD_READ | FD_WRITE | FD_OOB | FD_ACCEPT | FD_CONNECT | FD_CLOSE,  
   int nProtocolType = 0,  
   int nAddressFormat = PF_INET  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nSocketType`  
 Specifies `SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM`.  
  
 `lEvent`  
 A bitmask that specifies a combination of network events in which the application is interested.  
  
-   `FD_READ`: Want to receive notification of readiness for reading.  
  
-   `FD_WRITE`: Want to receive notification of readiness for writing.  
  
-   `FD_OOB`: Want to receive notification of the arrival of out-of-band data.  
  
-   `FD_ACCEPT`: Want to receive notification of incoming connections.  
  
-   `FD_CONNECT`: Want to receive notification of completed connection.  
  
-   `FD_CLOSE`: Want to receive notification of socket closure.  
  
 `nProtocolType`  
 Protocol to be used with the socket that is specific to the indicated address family.  
  
 `nAddressFormat`  
 Address family specification.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns `TRUE` on success, `FALSE` on failure.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method allocates a socket handle. It does not call [Bind](../vs140/CAsyncSocket--Bind.md) to bind the socket to a specified address, so you need to call `Bind` later to bind the socket to a specified address. You can use [SetSockOpt](../vs140/CAsyncSocket--SetSockOpt.md) to set the socket option before it is bound.
