# value_compare Class
Provides a function object that can compare the elements of a hash_map by comparing the values of their keys to determine their relative order in the hash_map.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class value_compare  
    : std::public binary_function<value_type, value_type, bool>   
{  
public:  
    bool operator( )(  
        const value_type& _Left,  
        const value_type& _Right ) const  
        {  
            return ( comp( _Left.first, _Right.first ) );   
        }  
protected:  
    value_compare( const key_compare& c ) : comp (c) { }  
    key_compare comp;  
};  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The comparison criteria provided by value_compare between **value_types** of whole elements contained by a hash_map is induced from a comparison between the keys of the respective elements by the auxiliary class construction. The member function operator uses the object **comp** of type `key_compare` stored in the function object provided by value_compare to compare the sort-key components of two elements.  
  
 For hash_sets and hash_multisets, which are simple containers where the key values are identical to the element values, value_compare is equivalent to `key_compare`; for hash_maps and hash_multimaps they are not, because the value of the type `pair` elements is not identical to the value of the element's key.  
  
 In Visual C++ .NET 2003, members of the [<hash_map>](../vs140/-hash_map-.md) and [<hash_set>](../vs140/-hash_set-.md) header files are no longer in the std namespace, but rather have been moved into the stdext namespace. See [The stdext Namespace](../vs140/stdext-Namespace.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
 See the example for [hash_map::value_comp](../vs140/hash_map-Class.md#hash_map__value_comp) for an example of how to declare and use value_compare.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <hash_map>  
  
 **Namespace:** stdext
