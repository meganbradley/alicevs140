# operator- (&lt;complex&gt;)2
Divides two complex numbers, one or both of which may belong to the subset of the type for the real and imaginary parts.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> operator*(  
      const complex<Type>& _Left,  
      const complex<Type>& _Right  
   );  
template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> operator*(  
      const complex<Type>& _Left,  
      const Type& _Right  
   );  
template<class Type>  
   complex<Type> operator*(  
      const Type& _Left,  
      const complex<Type>& _Right  
   );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Left`  
 A complex number or a number that is of the parameter type for a complex number that is the numerator to be divided by the denominator with the / operation.  
  
 `_Right`  
 A complex number or a number that is of the parameter type for a complex number that is the denominator to be used to divide the numerator with the / operation.  
  
## Return Value  
 The complex number that results from the division of the numerator by the denominator, the values of which are specified by the parameter inputs.  
  
## Remarks  
 The operation is overloaded so that simple arithmetic operations can be executed without the conversion of the data to a particular format.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// complex_op_div.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <complex>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
   double pi = 3.14159265359;  
  
   // Example of the first member function  
   // type complex<double> divided by type complex<double>  
   complex <double> cl1 ( polar ( 3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   complex <double> cr1 ( polar ( 2.0 , pi / 3 ) );  
   complex <double> cs1 = cl1 / cr1;  
  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl1 = " << cl1 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr1 = " << cr1 << endl;  
   cout << "The quotient of the two complex numbers is: cs1 = cl1 /cr1 = "  
        << cs1 << endl;  
   double abscs1 = abs ( cs1 );  
   double argcs1 = arg ( cs1 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cs1 is: " << abscs1 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cs1 is: "<< argcs1 << " radians, which is "   
        << argcs1 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;   
  
   // example of the second member function  
   // type complex<double> divided by type double  
   complex <double> cl2 ( polar (3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   double cr2 =5;  
   complex <double> cs2 = cl2 / cr2;  
  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl2 = " << cl2 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr2 = " << cr2 << endl;  
   cout << "The quotient of the two complex numbers is: cs2 = cl2 /cr2 = "   
        << cs2 << endl;  
   double abscs2 = abs ( cs2 );  
   double argcs2 = arg ( cs2 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cs2 is: " << abscs2 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cs2 is: "<< argcs2 << " radians, which is "   
        << argcs2 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;  
  
   // Example of the third member function  
   // type double divided by type complex<double>  
   double cl3 = 5;  
   complex <double> cr3 ( polar ( 3.0 , pi / 6 ) );  
   complex <double> cs3 = cl3 / cr3;  
  
   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl3 = " << cl3 << endl;  
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr3 = " << cr3 << endl;  
   cout << "The quotient of the two complex numbers is: cs3 = cl3 /cr2 = "  
        << cs3 << endl;  
   double abscs3 = abs ( cs3 );  
   double argcs3 = arg ( cs3 );  
   cout << "The modulus of cs3 is: " << abscs3 << endl;  
   cout << "The argument of cs3 is: "<< argcs3 << " radians, which is "   
        << argcs3 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;  
}
