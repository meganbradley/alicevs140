# ISource::reserve Method
When overridden in a derived class, reserves a message previously offered by this `ISource` block.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
virtual bool reserve(  
   runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> * _PTarget  
) = 0;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `reserve` method.  
  
## Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise. Reservations can fail for many reasons, including: the message was already reserved or accepted by another target, the source could deny reservations, and so forth.  
  
## Remarks  
 After you call `reserve`, if it succeeds, you must call either `consume` or `release` in order to take or give up possession of the message, respectively.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency
