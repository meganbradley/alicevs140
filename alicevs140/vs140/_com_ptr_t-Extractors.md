# _com_ptr_t Extractors
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Extract the encapsulated COM interface pointer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      operator Interface*( ) const throw( );   
operator Interface&( ) const;   
Interface& operator*( ) const;   
Interface* operator->( ) const;   
Interface** operator&( ) throw( );   
operator bool( ) const throw( );  
```  
  
## Remarks  
  
-   **operator Interface\*** Returns the encapsulated interface pointer, which may be **NULL**.  
  
-   **operator Interface&** Returns a reference to the encapsulated interface pointer, and issues an error if the pointer is **NULL**.  
  
-   **operator\*** Allows a smart pointer object to act as though it were the actual encapsulated interface when dereferenced.  
  
-   **operator->** Allows a smart pointer object to act as though it were the actual encapsulated interface when dereferenced.  
  
-   **operator&** Releases any encapsulated interface pointer, replacing it with **NULL**, and returns the address of the encapsulated pointer. This allows the smart pointer to be passed by address to a function that has an **out** parameter through which it returns an interface pointer.  
  
-   **operator bool** Allows a smart pointer object to be used in a conditional expression. This operator returns **true** if the pointer is not **NULL**.
