# Creating Screens in LightSwitch
Screens in LightSwitch are used to display, enter, or update data that is stored in a database or other data source. In an earlier lesson you learned how to create a common set of screens for the Contacts entity. In this set of lessons youâ€™ll learn how to modify an existing screen, create new screens, and customize their appearance.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These lessons build upon the My First Application project that you last modified in the [Defining Relationships](../vs140/Defining-Relationships-in-a-LightSwitch-Application.md) lesson. If your application isn't already open in Visual Studio, on the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open Project** to open it.
