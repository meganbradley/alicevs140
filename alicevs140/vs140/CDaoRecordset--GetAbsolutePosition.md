# CDaoRecordset::GetAbsolutePosition
Returns the record number of a recordset object's current record.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
long GetAbsolutePosition( );  
  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 An integer from 0 to the number of records in the recordset. Corresponds to the ordinal position of the current record in the recordset.  
  
## Remarks  
 The AbsolutePosition property value of the underlying DAO object is zero-based; a setting of 0 refers to the first record in the recordset. You can determine the number of populated records in the recordset by calling [GetRecordCount](../vs140/CDaoRecordset--GetRecordCount.md). Calling `GetRecordCount` may take some time because it must access all records to determine the count.  
  
 If there is no current record, as when there are no records in the recordset, â€“ 1 is returned. If the current record is deleted, the AbsolutePosition property value is not defined, and MFC throws an exception if it is referenced. For dynaset-type recordsets, new records are added to the end of the sequence.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This property is not intended to be used as a surrogate record number. Bookmarks are still the recommended way of retaining and returning to a given position and are the only way to position the current record across all types of recordset objects. In particular, the position of a given record changes when record(s) preceding it are deleted. There is also no assurance that a given record will have the same absolute position if the recordset is re-created again because the order of individual records within a recordset is not guaranteed unless it is created with a SQL statement using an **ORDER BY** clause.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is valid only for dynaset-type and snapshot-type recordsets.
