# &#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by a parameter that is marked as &#39;ByRef&#39; versus &#39;ByVal&#39;
You have attempted to override a method with another method that differs by a parameter marked `ByRef` instead of `ByVal`. Overridden members must have the same arguments as the inherited members from the base class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30398  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the parameters are either both `ByRef` or both `ByVal`.
