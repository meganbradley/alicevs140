# IDiaAddressMap::put_addressMapEnabled
Specifies whether the address map should be used to translate symbol addresses.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT put_addressMapEnabled (   
   BOOL NewVal  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 NewVal  
 [in] Set to `TRUE` to enable the translation of symbols, or `FALSE` to disable.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code.  
  
## Remarks  
 Executable post-processors sometimes update the executable. DIA contains a mechanism to support the translation of symbols to the new layout.  
  
 When a PDB file is loaded, the address map stored in the file is enabled. There are times, however, when a client application may need to supply its own address map by calling the [IDiaAddressMap::set_addressMap](../vs140/IDiaAddressMap--set_addressMap.md) method. If the `set_addressMap` method is successful, the client application must call the `put_addressMapEnabled` method with a `NewVal` parameter of `TRUE` to enable the use of that address map.  
  
 The current state of the address map being enabled can be retrieved with a call to the [IDiaAddressMap::get_addressMapEnabled](../vs140/IDiaAddressMap--get_addressMapEnabled.md) method.
