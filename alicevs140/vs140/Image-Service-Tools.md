# Image Service Tools
The VS SDK includes several tools to help extension builders use the Visual Studio image service.  
  
-   The [Manifest from Resources](../vs140/Manifest-from-Resources.md) tool takes a list of image resources (.png or .xaml files) and generates an image manifest file.  
  
-   The [Manifest to Code](../vs140/Manifest-to-Code.md) tool takes an image manifest file and generates a wrapper file to use in C++, C#, VB, or .vsct files.  
  
-   The [Visual Studio Image Library Viewer](../vs140/Image-Library-Viewer.md) can load, edit, and search image manifests.
