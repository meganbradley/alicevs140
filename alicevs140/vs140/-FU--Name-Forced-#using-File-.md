# -FU (Name Forced #using File)
A compiler option that you can use as an alternative to passing a file name to [#using Directive](../vs140/#using-Directive--C---.md) in source code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/FU file  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `file`  
 Specifies the metadata file to reference in this compilation.  
  
## Remarks  
 The /FU switch takes just one file name. To specify multiple files, use /FU with each one.  
  
 If you are using [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../vs140/includes/cppcli_md.md)] and are referencing metadata to use the [Friend Assemblies](../Topic/Friend%20Assemblies%20\(C++\).md) feature, you can't use **/FU**. You must reference the metadata in code by using `#using`â€”together with the `[as friend]` attribute. Friend assemblies are not supported in [!INCLUDE[cppwrt](../vs140/includes/cppwrt_md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../vs140/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)]).  
  
 For information about how to create an assembly or module for the common language runtime (CLR), see [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../Topic/-clr%20\(Common%20Language%20Runtime%20Compilation\).md). For information about how to build in [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../vs140/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)], see [Building apps and libraries (C++/CX)](assetId:///ec2821a5-3479-4e64-9c2d-c777049f2cdc).  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [How to: Open Project Property Pages](../vs140/How-to--Open-Project-Property-Pages.md).  
  
2.  Select the **C/C++** folder.  
  
3.  Select the **Advanced** property page.  
  
4.  Modify the **Force #using** property.  
  
### To set this compiler option programmatically  
  
-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.ForcedUsingFiles?qualifyHint=False>.
