# -HIGHENTROPYVA
Specifies whether the executable image supports high-entropy 64-bit address space layout randomization (ASLR).  
  
```  
  
/HIGHENTROPYVA[:NO]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This option modifies the header of a .dll file or .exe file to indicate whether ASLR with 64-bit addresses is supported. When this option is set on an executable and all of the modules that it depends on, an operating system that supports 64-bit ASLR can rebase the segments of the executable image at load time by using randomized addresses in a 64-bit virtual address space. This large address space makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess the location of a particular memory region.  
  
 By default, the linker sets this option for 64-bit executable images. To set this option, the [/DYNAMICBASE](../vs140/-DYNAMICBASE.md) option must also be set.
