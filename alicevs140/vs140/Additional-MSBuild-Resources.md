# Additional MSBuild Resources
If you are trying to solve a problem and cannot find the information you need in the documentation, you can consult other resources such as Knowledge Base articles, the developer community, or product support.  
  
## Knowledge Base Articles  
 You can search the Knowledge Base (KB) online for articles about product issues. Not all issues have a corresponding KB article, but errors encountered by a significant number of customers are typically documented. You can access KB articles on the [Knowledge Base (MSBuild search results)](http://search.microsoft.com/supportresults.aspx?q=knowledge+base+MSBuild&x=0&y=0) Web site.  
  
## Community Forums  
 Forums let you interact with other developers, and also Microsoft employees. If you encounter an error that you cannot find a resolution for, you can post questions about the issue on a forum. You can also search the newsgroups to see whether others have posted about the same issue. You can access the Visual Studio MSBuild forum on the [MSDN Forums](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=48931) Web site.  
  
 You can access [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../vs140/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] community resources on the [Channel 9 MSBuild](http://channel9.msdn.com/) Web site.  
  
## Product Support  
 If you still have questions after you try the other resources, you can contact Microsoft support services by visiting the [Microsoft Help and Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=1782) Web site. For information about product support available in your area, see [Getting Help from Microsoft Product Support Services (Visual Studio)](../vs140/Talk-to-Us.md).
