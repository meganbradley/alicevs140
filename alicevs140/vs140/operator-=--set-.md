# operator&gt;= (set)
Tests if the set object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the set object on the right side.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      bool operator!>=(  
   const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& _Left,  
   const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& _Right  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Left`  
 An object of type **set**.  
  
 `_Right`  
 An object of type **set**.  
  
## Return Value  
 **true** if the set on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the set on the right side of the list; otherwise **false**.  
  
## Remarks  
 The comparison between set objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The greater than or equal to relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// set_op_ge.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <set>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
   set <int> s1, s2, s3, s4;  
   int i;  
  
   for ( i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ )  
   {  
      s1.insert ( i );  
      s2.insert ( i * i );  
      s3.insert ( i - 1 );  
      s4.insert ( i );  
   }  
  
   if ( s1 >= s2 )  
      cout << "Set s1 is greater than or equal to set s2." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The set s1 is less than the set s2." << endl;  
  
   if ( s1 >= s3 )  
      cout << "Set s1 is greater than or equal to set s3." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The set s1 is less than the set s3." << endl;  
  
   if ( s1 >= s4 )  
      cout << "Set s1 is greater than or equal to set s4." << endl;  
   else  
      cout << "The set s1 is less than the set s4." << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 **The set s1 is less than the set s2.**  
**Set s1 is greater than or equal to set s3.**  
**Set s1 is greater than or equal to set s4.**   
## Requirements  
 **Header:** <set\>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
