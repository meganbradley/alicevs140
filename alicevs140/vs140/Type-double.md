# Type double
Double precision values with double type have 8 bytes. The format is similar to the float format except that it has an 11-bit excess-1023 exponent and a 52-bit mantissa, plus the implied high-order 1 bit. This format gives a range of approximately 1.7E–308 to 1.7E+308 for type double.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The double type contains 64 bits: 1 for sign, 11 for the exponent, and 52 for the mantissa. Its range is +/–1.7E308 with at least 15 digits of precision.
