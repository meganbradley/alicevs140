# _CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince
Dumps information about objects in the heap from the start of program execution or from a specified heap state (debug version only).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void _CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince(   
   const _CrtMemState *state   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `state`  
 Pointer to the heap state to begin dumping from or **NULL**.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince` function dumps the debug header information of objects allocated in the heap in a user-readable form. The dump information can be used by the application to track allocations and detect memory problems. When [_DEBUG](../vs140/_DEBUG.md) is not defined, calls to `_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince` are removed during preprocessing.  
  
 `_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince` uses the value of the `state` parameter to determine where to initiate the dump operation. To begin dumping from a specified heap state, the `state` parameter must be a pointer to a **_CrtMemState** structure that has been filled in by [_CrtMemCheckpoint](../vs140/_CrtMemCheckpoint.md) before `_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince` was called. When `state` is **NULL**, the function begins the dump from the start of program execution.  
  
 If the application has installed a dump hook function by calling [_CrtSetDumpClient](../vs140/_CrtSetDumpClient.md), then every time `_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince` dumps information about a `_CLIENT_BLOCK` type of block, it calls the application-supplied dump function as well. By default, internal C run-time blocks (`_CRT_BLOCK`) are not included in memory dump operations. The [_CrtSetDbgFlag](../vs140/_CrtSetDbgFlag.md) function can be used to turn on the `_CRTDBG_CHECK_CRT_DF` bit of **_crtDbgFlag** to include these blocks. In addition, blocks marked as freed or ignored (**_FREE_BLOCK**, **_IGNORE_BLOCK**) are not included in the memory dump.  
  
 For more information about heap state functions and the `_CrtMemState` structure, see [Heap State Reporting Functions](../vs140/CRT-Debug-Heap-Details.md#BKMK_Heap_State_Reporting_Functions). For more information about how memory blocks are allocated, initialized, and managed in the debug version of the base heap, see [CRT Debug Heap Details](../vs140/CRT-Debug-Heap-Details.md).
